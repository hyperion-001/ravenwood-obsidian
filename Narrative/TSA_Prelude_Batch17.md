## INITIAL CONSIDERATIONS
The river hemlock essence sits before me, its dark liquid catching the lamplight like captured shadows. After six months of failure, I have been driven to alter the fundamental balance of our preparation. The proportion now favors the hemlock's mysterious properties over the familiar comfort of willow bark, guided less by established principles than by an instinct that grows stronger even as my rational mind counsels caution. Perhaps within its depths lies the key to influencing the vital spirits that carry pain to the brain, achieving what laudanum's brute force cannot.

## PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS
The mice provided our first insights, though hardly the ones we sought. Their small bodies offered perfect clarity in failure - the first group's unchanged suffering, the second group's descent into familiar stupor, and most troubling, the violent disruption of vital spirits that claimed our final subjects. Each death marks another path proven false, another theory collapsed under the weight of evidence.

The Norwegian rats followed, their larger forms allowing for more precise observation of the preparation's effects. We exposed living tissue, applied our solution with careful precision, and watched. The first subjects' continued suffering proved our inadequacy. The middle group offered a cruel glimpse of possibility before hope collapsed. The final subjects' strange behavior before death suggested something - but what? Their expiration denied us answers, leaving only questions that haunt my midnight reflections.

## LARGER SUBJECT TRIAL
The adult hare represented a significant investment of our dwindling resources and proved every bit as disappointing as our previous attempts. Its initial response to the preparation seemed promising - a blessed quieting of distress that lifted my hopes briefly toward something like optimism. But like all our previous work, this too proved ephemeral. The return to natural agitation seemed to mock our efforts at intervention.

## FINAL OBSERVATION
The hunting hound lies before me now, its compound fracture a grotesque mirror of injuries I've witnessed too often in my surgical practice. The afternoon light streams through the laboratory windows, illuminating the exposed bone with an almost divine clarity. The preparation has been applied according to our revised method, though hope has become a stranger to these proceedings.

The severity of the injury demands immediate intervention. Blood flows as it must, the preparation is applied, and we begin our work. And then...

What follows seems to defy the very laws of nature. The subject maintains complete wakefulness, yet shows no sign of distress. No restraints are needed - indeed, they seem to have been forgotten entirely. Even as we manipulate the broken bone, there is no response that suggests suffering. The procedure continues with an ease that borders on the miraculous, the dog remaining calm and aware throughout.

In these immediate moments after the procedure, I observe the subject with a mixture of scientific fascination and something approaching fear. It remains alert, showing no signs of distress, all natural faculties apparently unimpaired. Yet something fundamental has been altered, though the precise nature of this change eludes my current understanding.

### Initial Considerations
For this preparation, I have altered the balance of ingredients significantly from previous attempts. The river hemlock essence now takes greater prominence in relation to the willow preparation, guided by my growing suspicion that the key lies in influencing the vital spirits that carry pain to the brain. In theory, this might achieve our aims without inducing the common stupor seen in traditional remedies.

### Preliminary Observations
Our first trials with common mice proved disheartening. The initial subjects showed no apparent change in their humors when the preparation was applied to small wounds. Those in the second group fell into an excessive stupor, no better than common laudanum. Most troubling were the final subjects, which showed a violent disruption of their vital spirits before expiration.

Moving to Norwegian rats allowed for more careful observation. We applied the preparation directly to exposed tissues during bone compression. The first subjects showed no alteration in behavior whatsoever. While the middle group displayed some reduction in signs of distress, the final subjects exhibited a strange agitation before they inevitably expired. Without the ability to properly study these reactions, we cannot determine if this represents progress or yet another failure.

### Larger Subject Trial
The adult hare initially gave cause for hope. Upon applying the preparation directly to a deliberate injury of the leg, we observed an immediate quieting of distress. However, this effect maintained only briefly before the creature returned to its natural state, showing even greater agitation than before. No lasting change could be observed.

### Final Observations
Today's subject was a male hunting hound in prime condition, the Duke's prized hunting dog in fact, presenting with a compound fracture of the right foreleg. The afternoon was clear, providing good light for the procedure. We applied the preparation directly to both the exposed bone and surrounding tissues.

Initial examination revealed the severity of the injury, with blood flow consistent with such trauma. After applying the preparation according to our revised method, we commenced surgical intervention. What followed defied my expectations to say the least.

The subject maintained full waking awareness throughout the procedure, yet required no physical restraint of any kind. The natural responses to such grievous injury were entirely absent. Even direct manipulation of the broken bone produced no visible distress. We achieved complete repair of the fracture without incident, while the subject remained seemingly calm and aware throughout the entire procedure.

In the immediate aftermath, the subject remains alert and responsive, showing no signs of distress. All natural faculties appear unimpaired. Further observation is warranted of course, as the risk of fever remains high due to the injury, though the immediate success of the procedure cannot be denied.

*[Margin Note: The weight of failure bears down like a physical presence. Yet something in the peculiar nature of river hemlock calls to me, hinting at secrets beyond our current understanding. The Duke's increasing difficulties with gout drive me forward, though my confidence wanes with each passing day. -G.A.]*

*[Margin Note: Even as I record these failures, I hear the screams of yesterday's surgery. Each dead end mocks our pretensions of progress while human suffering continues unabated. -G.A.]*

*[Margin Note: These peculiar reactions before death suggest something beyond our current framework of understanding. Yet each insight slips away with the final breath of our subjects. The shadows of uncertainty grow longer. -G.A.]*

*[Margin Note: Another false dawn. The pattern becomes nearly unbearable - hope raised only to be dashed. The Duke's patience surely must be reaching its limit, as is my own. -G.A.]*

*[Margin Note: One final attempt before acknowledging defeat. Let this at least serve as a warning to those who follow this path. -G.A.]*

*[Margin Note: My hand trembles as I write this. The dog's eyes - there is awareness there, complete consciousness, yet no sign of pain. It defies everything we know. -G.A.]*

*[Margin Note: The implications thunder through my mind like summer storms. Not mere suppression, but complete absence of pain while consciousness remains unimpaired. The possibilities... but we must proceed with utmost caution. -G.A.]*

*[Margin Note: Sleep will not find me this night. The doors we have opened cannot be closed, and I find myself wondering if they should have remained sealed. Yet we must press forward. The Duke must be informed, but carefully. Some knowledge requires delicate handling. -G.A.]*
