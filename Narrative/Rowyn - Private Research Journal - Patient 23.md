Surgical Apprentice

Today, I witnessed something extraordinary. Something that has awakened a hunger in me I scarcely knew existed.

Patient 23 lay before us, the usual procedures underway, when suddenly - oh, what a moment! The Monarchium's embrace faltered, and pain bloomed across their features like ink in water. While others recoiled, I found myself drawn closer. I could feel my own blood pulsing behind my eyes while through my chest there blossomed a fire that spread into my entire body and mind. In that instant, I beheld something precious: the perfect midpoint between agony and ecstasy, crystallized before my eyes. 

My colleagues saw only failure, but I saw truth. The way consciousness flickered behind their eyes, how their fingers clutched at empty air - every spasm told a story of transformation. I could almost taste the moment when pleasure became pain became transcendence. Something new. Something wonderful.

Dr. Harrison intervened too quickly. Always too quickly. They don't understand that these moments of "failure" are where real discovery lives. In that liminal space between comfort and agony, there are secrets waiting to be understood. To be possessed.

I've requested access to the restricted archives. There must be other cases, other moments like this, documented and hidden away. I dream of those records, of the knowledge they contain. Of all the thresholds we might cross, if only we dare to look closer.

The others whisper that I lack appropriate sympathy. They don't understand. How can one truly heal without first understanding pain in all its exquisite forms? I don't want to merely ease suffering - I want to master it. To reshape it. To own it.

Tonight I will review my notes again. Something pulls at me, some thread of understanding just beyond my grasp. I feel as though I'm on the edge of something vast and terrible and beautiful. Like standing at the lip of a great chasm, knowing that somewhere in its depths lies everything I've ever yearned for.

Patient 23 recovers in the ward below. Sometimes I can still hear their whimpers echoing through the stones. The sound follows me into my dreams, not as a haunting, but as a promise.

Must remember to maintain proper clinical distance in official documentation. Save these... deeper observations for private reflection. For now.
