Let's adjust the birthing chamber scene slightly in order to fully capture seraphinas personality disorder
Crucial elements:
- midwives would have been present
- seraphinas pathology will have progressed to a feeling that her criminality will never be discovered
- indeed, the midwives continue to "trust" sseraphina despite rumors, which is consistent with human behavior (kind of like a bystander effect or the general public not wanting to stand up to authority because it would upset the status quo, i can't remember the exact term)
- at this point the duchess is aware of seraphina's evilness but is going into labor regardless, so is powerless
