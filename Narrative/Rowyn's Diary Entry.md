From the Personal Diary of Rowyn Kingsley
Surgical Apprentice
[..date..]

The air is wet today, penetrating the skin and forming rivulets that fall down the windows, exposing what is beyond. Even the leaves seemed to enjoy it, these dead and rotting vestiges of summer's glory now fallen from grace. They huddled together on the ground now, protecting their comrades with a loyalty that transcended their former station as nature's decay descended to work. 

I picked up some of the leaves out of curiosity as I awaited my transport. Rowan -- the berries above gave away its identity like blood spatter. Yet I found these leaves curious as I held them. As I pulled them apart they clung together with a certain liminality that was almost intimate, easily separable yet unwilling. I sensed the same intimacy in the driver's gaze as he helped me ascend the carriage steps. 

What compels mankind? I have seen brain matter, held it in my hand in the anatomy theaters in Edinburgh. What are the drivers of the grey? How do the humors sum? What tendencies are yet to be? What is yet to be known and discovered? Each wonder that is revealed comes in rapture. Some of my colleagues have likened it to divine inspiration, but it is merely transcendence. 

More later. The track through the Cheviots is proving rough and my driver seems intent upon reaching our destination.
