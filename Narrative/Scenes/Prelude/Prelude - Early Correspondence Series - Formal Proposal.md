###### From His Grace, the Duke of Ravenwood To His Most Excellent Majesty, George II 15th March, 1756

Your Most Gracious Majesty,

Following Dr. Ranby's most productive visit to Ravenwood, I write to formally propose the establishment of a properly chartered institution for medical research, with particular focus on the advancement of surgical science and the development of Monarchium.

Such an institution would require:

1. Royal protection and oversight
2. Formal authority to conduct surgical research
3. Proper facilities for pharmaceutical development
4. Secure protocols for testing and refinement
5. Framework for training selected surgeons
6. Discretion in all sensitive matters

I would be honored to submit a detailed proposal for Your Majesty's consideration, outlining the specific requirements and suggested protocols for such an establishment.

Your Most Humble and Obedient Servant

Malcolm Ashwood Duke of Ravenwood
