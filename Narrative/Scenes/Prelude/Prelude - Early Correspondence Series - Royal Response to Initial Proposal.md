###### From His Majesty's Secretary To His Grace, the Duke of Ravenwood 3rd February, 1756

Your Grace,

His Majesty has taken great interest in your letter regarding this new medicinal compound, Monarchium, and its potential significance for military surgery.

His Majesty has instructed me to inform you that His personal physician, Dr. Jonathan Ranby, shall visit Ravenwood with all haste to observe these developments. You are to provide him with such demonstrations as will allow him to fully assess the potential of this innovation.

His Majesty further directs that until Dr. Ranby's visit, you are to maintain absolute discretion regarding these developments.

By His Majesty's Command

Henry Fox

Secretary of State for the Southern Department
