###### From Dr. Jonathan Ranby To His Most Excellent Majesty, George II 1st March, 1756

Your Majesty,

I write following my comprehensive examination of the medical advances being pursued at Ravenwood Castle. It is my considered opinion that the Duke of Ravenwood's initial report, if anything, understated the significance of what has been achieved.

The compound they have termed Monarchium represents a remarkable advancement in surgical medicine. I personally witnessed procedures that would ordinarily be impossible without dangerous quantities of opium, performed with precision and success. The implications for military surgery alone would justify serious consideration of the Duke's position.

However, the current arrangements at Ravenwood, while promising, are insufficient for work of this importance. The research requires proper protection, both physical and legal, as well as a framework for controlling its development and eventual deployment.

I strongly recommend that Your Majesty consider establishing Ravenwood as a formally chartered institution for medical research, with particular emphasis on surgical innovation. The Duke's proposal for a dedicated research facility under Crown protection appears to be the most prudent course of action.

Your Most Humble Servant, 

Jonathan Ranby 

Sergeant-Surgeon to His Majesty
