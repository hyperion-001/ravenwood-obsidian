###### From His Grace, the Duke of Ravenwood To His Most Excellent Majesty, George II 12th January, 1756

Your Most Gracious Majesty,

I write with news of a development that I believe merits Your Majesty's immediate attention, particularly given the pressing needs of our brave soldiers and sailors in the present conflict with France.

Our surgeon, Dr. Aldrich, has achieved what I believe to be a breakthrough of profound significance. Through careful research and experimentation, he has discovered an entirely new class of medicines which he terms "neogesia." This innovation promises to revolutionize the management of pain during surgical procedures, a matter of urgent concern given the grievous wounds sustained by Your Majesty's forces both at sea and in the colonies.

The most promising compound, which we have named Monarchium in anticipation of Your Majesty's interest, shows unprecedented efficacy in allowing patients to endure even the most difficult procedures without the drawbacks common to opium and its derivatives. Most crucially, it does not produce the vapours which so often affect our surgeons during delicate operations, a limitation that has cost many lives in field hospitals and naval surgeries.

While our initial results show great promise, I write not merely to inform Your Majesty of this discovery, but to suggest that with proper support and protection, this innovation could be developed to serve the greater interests of the Crown. The sensitive nature of such research, combined with its potential military applications, suggests the need for a formal framework under which to pursue these advances.

I would be honored to host Your Majesty's personal physician at Ravenwood to witness our progress, should it please You to send him. Our current facilities, though modest, have already demonstrated their suitability for this work.

Your Most Humble and Obedient Servant, Malcolm Ashwood Duke of Ravenwood
