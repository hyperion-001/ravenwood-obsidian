- [ ] Meat Shipment
	This scene focuses on a sailor piloting a boat of "beef" up the river Coquet to Rothbury and Ravenwood Castle, visible in the distance as he unloads his shipment at the docks in rothbury. Reflections on how unsettled he feels up in this area. He has a rough accent, superstitious in a sailor sort of way. Maybe he brings news from London or the war as well. Of course, some of the "beef" in the cargo, packed delicately with salt perhaps, are human bodies, bound for Ravenwood castle and the anatomy lab. Our sailor may or may not be privy to the smuggling but it would be unlikely he was unaware I would think.


## Act 1

- [ ] [[Rowyn's Arrival at Ravenwood]] ^qquhzw
	This will be Rowyn's first day at Ravenwood. She walks through a sculpture garden on the way up to the front and pauses to contemplate a statue of a woman. The statue is missing its arms. Seraphina briefly wonders what it would be like to be this woman, beautiful but powerless. This will i think represent her first exposure to the castle as her "familiar".


## Act 2



## Act 3

- [ ] [[The Forgotten Study]]
	Rowyn’s Turning Point
	This hidden study within Ravenwood Castle serves as a critical juncture in the narrative, marking the moment when Rowyn’s curiosity begins to transform into a consuming obsession with secret knowledge. It is here that she realizes the true power that comes from understanding the unknown—power to manipulate minds, influence actions, and ultimately, control those around her. This newfound revelation distances her from Lucian, whom she now views as having fulfilled his purpose. With her pursuit of deeper, more arcane knowledge, she starts seeing him as irrelevant to her ambitions.


## Act 4



## Act 5



## Prologue/Epilogue Canonical

- [ ] [[The Wood From The Tree]]
	There is a door in Ravenwood Castle. It is perhaps forgotten. A secret. It's darkest secret.....
	Adam looks at The Tree and seethes. *Fuck the day I was born. Fuck this land and this garden.* He picks up his axe. *And fuck the knowledge.* As the blade makes contact with the tree splinters fill the air. "Listen to me! Is this what you wanted?! Is this your plan for Creation?!"
