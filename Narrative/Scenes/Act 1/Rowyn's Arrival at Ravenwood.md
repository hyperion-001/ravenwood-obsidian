## Free Writing
Rowyn walks slowly up to the gates at ravenwood.
her mother had just died. she never knew her father.
she had no one. just herself. and an opportunity now.

oh god what was she going to do
she had always been fascinated with the darkness

i thought about keeping having rowyn's thoughts revealed like flashing back somewhat but those will have to be minimal i think 

but maybe they can remain in these scene notes as reminders of what is going into her motivations and thoughts.
because yes it goes into her state of being. because sh'ell be writing this as her diary. but 

a rowyn diary will have a particular flavor. **focused on the present moment** i think is how it could be described

here we go. 

i see autumn leaves, wet, one laying on top of the other. stuck together with a film of mildew and moisture between. gravel crunches. or stone. there is the end of the path or the drive. she is tired from travel. 

castle sounds disturb her as they float down. too cheery. too mundane, provincial. but the castle was a glory to behold. she determined to possess it.

but the sights and sounds are cold, wet. she wears something maybe here at first that is more functional but later perhaps her style transforms to favoring more seductive clothing as she finds out it can get her things, specifically the theme of women in the medical profession at this time period will affect how she changes her approach as she transforms into more of a manipulative individual. but for now she wears travel clothes? clothes to make a first impression? clothes to not stand out?

cool, damp, clinging to the skin, she can almost feel a sense of being watched. the statues... even without heads or arms some of them seem to be able to see right through her.... no thats not right... that's too quick for her to feel that self conscious and perilous i think.

the death of her mother scrapes at her psyche. the way she watched her die. watched her fight for a last breath but couldn't give it. did that make her responsible? did that mean she killed her? 

she could feel the life flowing out of her like a river but she couldn't stop it. it was never ending... where did it all come from....

did Rowyn start out like this? does she have a choice? do i have a choice in writing her? 

perhaps she sees her mother as the sculpture in the garden--broken, somehow still able to see her, macabre, anatomically imperfect, on display..... I'm listening to the *Chernobyl* soundtrack as i imagine Rowyn looking over the statue. like a Geiger counter. there's something off about it that calls out to you..... scraping, pulling, reaching, whining, grasping, like a surface film.... The ancient castle... holding secrets and a mind of its own almost, masquerading as her mother in the form of this statue, setting a hook, working to push Rowyn over the edge of sanity into the darkness

### Reflection on the free writing

it surprised me, thinking about incorporating her mother's death into the tale as a potential prime mover in the events that shape Rowyn's life and psyche. it occurred to me as i thought of her walking up to the castle and her independence. who did she have? perhaps no one... at the moment she arrived... it would give her another dimension to tell her character as if she were someone who was already independent but now wrestling with the question of "am i truly as independent as i thought?" she is, of course, ultimately our main character and we have to send her down the dark road. but to have a character like hers that will be faced with choosing her path, perhaps now before she is completely ready. it raises questions of responsibility. if the death of her mother had not occurred would she have been thrust into ravenwood when she was? does she wrestle with feelings of other family not wanting her? at what point does a criminal become a criminal?

i'm actually drawing on personal experience a little when it comes to rowyn. i remember when my mother died, feeling powerless and watching, and the feelings afterwards. i've done counseling so i'm good but this book is definitely a form of catharsis as it is for most authors.

i think, looking at it from a clinical standpoint if rowyn were an actual patient, according to criteria and actual research she will have shown traits of cluster b personality disorder before the age of 18. so growing up she would have shown signs of what she would eventually become. (by the way i'm also in the medical field, i dont know if i've told you that before, so that's why i have some knowledge of the medical aspect of this.) as a character i think her mother's death probably accelerated the inevitable. it would be like if we had 2 people that were equally prone to something in real life but gave one of them a trauma that predisposed them more to it the one with the trauma would be more likely to actually eventually go down that road.
