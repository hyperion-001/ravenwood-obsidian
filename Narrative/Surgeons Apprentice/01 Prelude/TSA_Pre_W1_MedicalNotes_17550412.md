# Medical Notes - Musket Ball Surgery - 12 April 1755
Surgical Report
Ravenwood Estate
12 April 1755

Patient: 
Thomas Wells (age 12)
Son of James Wells, carpenter
Admitted: 12 April 1755, 2:15 p.m.

Presenting Condition:
Musket ball wound to right thigh, approximately four inches above knee. Entry wound appears inflamed and festering (48 hours since injury), with considerable heat to the touch and foul-smelling discharge. No exit wound visible. The surrounding flesh shows marked swelling and an angry red hue, suggesting significant humoral imbalance. Patient highly febrile and experiencing acute pain.

Treatment Attempts Prior to Surgery:
- Poultice application (elder woman in village)
- Laudanum administration (procured by father)
- Cold water compresses
All proving insufficient for pain management.

Surgical Procedure:
Time Commenced: 3:45 p.m.
Primary Surgeon: Gideon Aldrich
Assistant: William Harrison

Procedure Notes:
Initial examination revealed musket ball lodged against femur. Laudanum administered liberally throughout procedure, though effect proved insufficient. Patient required physical restraint. 

[Margin Note: Pain management methods prove consistently insufficient despite liberal application. Alternative approaches warrant investigation. -G.A.]

Incision made following entry path in deteriorating afternoon light. Limited visibility and persistent bleeding complicated extraction. Candlelight proved barely sufficient for deep probe work. Ball extraction severely hindered by position against bone and patient's violent movements. Total extraction time: 27 minutes.

[Margin Note: Procedure duration compromised by inadequate facilities. Dedicated surgical space required for optimal outcomes. -G.A.]

Observations of Note:
1. Laudanum effectiveness severely limited despite liberal use
2. Poor lighting significantly impeded precision
3. Procedure prolonged by uncontrolled patient movement
4. Assistant's steadiness affected by opium vapors
5. Father's distress and constant prayer proved significant disruption
6. Bleeding control limited by current tools and techniques

Immediate Outcome:
- Ball successfully extracted
- Wound washed with wine and dressed with clean linen
- Patient stabilized 
- Laudanum provided for recovery
- Fever persists

Recommendations:
1. Daily washing of wound with wine
2. Fresh linen dressing changes
3. Monitor for putrefaction
4. Limited movement
5. Continued laudanum as needed for pain

Follow-up examination scheduled for 13 April 1755.

Requirements for North Wing laboratory to be submitted separately. Current conditions prove insufficient for necessary research into advanced pain management methods. Proposed studies will require dedicated facilities and specialized equipment. Further details to follow through appropriate channels.
