From the Personal Diary of Gideon Aldrich
Chief Surgeon of Ravenwood Castle
April 12, 1755

Storms all day today. Thunder crashes into the night as I lay restless.

The boy's screams still ring in my ears. God help me, I had to pin him down myself while Harrison dug for the musket ball, the lead still hot and slick with blood. His father had spent their last shilling on laudanum - for all the good it did. I watched the man weep in the corner. I was reminded of my own father then, and the familiar ache returned to my right side. I felt just as helpless as this man, my hands today serving only to restrain rather than heal. 

My hands still shake with the memory. How many more must I hold down? How many more must I watch writhe and scream while we heal their flesh with our crude mercy? I gave the boy's father the last of the laudanum from the procedure.

Note: Place laudanum on the requisition order in the morning.

Our current methods sicken me. In the operating theatre opium vapors cloud everyone's minds - surgeon, assistants, the gallery. It causes my own and my colleagues' hands to grow unsteady at the crucial moment, our judgment clouded by the very substance meant to aid our work. And direct laudanum administration... I've lost count of how many have slipped away because we dared not give enough, or gave too much in our desperate attempt to ease suffering. Which is the greater mercy, I wonder?

Tonight's storm matches my thoughts - restless, turbulent. The rain itself hammers the windows like wet musket balls, every drop flashing with the lightning and illuminating the castle courtyard infinitesimal convexities. Every crash of thunder a cannon blast. I sit here, as if waiting to see where the hot lead will land. If only I'd not given away the last of the laudanum. 

It is during these restless nights that the singular thought seizes my mind like a barbed arrow. Paracelsus with his dreams of transformation. If these sounds can be transformed within my mind to the sounds of war what else in the mind might we transform? Might we one day transform agony in ways that we have not yet dreamed?

I've taken possession of the old monastery laboratory in the north wing. for a personal study. The isolation suits my purposes - and I confess, suits my mood. It will give me space to develop these thoughts.

My colleagues would mock me for this line of thinking of course. I can almost hear their sneering citations of Paracelsus in the halls of the Royal College. Mad old Paracelsus, with his dreams of transformation. But in my darkest hours, I wonder - was he mad to dream? Perhaps he was he simply willing to step beyond the comfortable boundaries that hold back lesser minds.

The Duke understands, or thinks he does. His gout will make him sympathetic to my requests for equipment and supplies. If he truly grasped what I propose... but no matter. This is beyond his comprehension. Beyond anyone's, perhaps, even my own.

I must rest, but I know sleep will not come. The boy's screams echo still, mixing with the thunder.
