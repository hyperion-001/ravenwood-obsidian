From the Personal Diary of Gideon Aldrich
Master Surgeon, Ravenwood Castle
April 12, 1755

Storms all day today. Thunder crashes into the night where I lay restless.

The boy's screams still ring in my ears. God help me, I had to pin him down myself while Harrison dug for the musket ball, slick with blood. His father had spent their last shilling on laudanum - for all the good it did. As I watched the man weep in the corner I saw my own father, watching his son suffer yet remaining helplessness. I felt just as helpless, my hands serving only to restrain rather than heal. My hands still shake with the memory. 

How many more must I hold down? It seems a cruel irony, watching these poor souls writhe and scream while we heal their flesh with our crude mercy. I gave the father the last of the laudanum from the procedure.

Current methods sicken me. The opium vapors cloud everyone's minds - surgeon, assistants, even the waiting patients. Mine and my colleagues' hands grow unsteady at the crucial moment, our judgment clouded by the very substance meant to aid our work. And direct laudanum administration... I've lost count of how many have slipped away because we dared not give enough, or gave too much in our desperate attempt to ease their suffering. I truly do not know which is worse.

Tonight's storm matches my thoughts - restless, turbulent. Each flash of lightning transforms the rain itself, pelting the windows like wet musket balls, every drop briefly glowing as they illuminate the castle courtyard with their convexity. Every crash of thunder a cannon blast. I sit here, as if waiting to see where the hot lead lands. If only I'd not given away the last of the laudanum before the next shipment. Days ago my mind was seized with a singular thought that will not release me: how else can our perception be shaped? 

I've taken possession of the old monastery laboratory in the north wing. The isolation suits my purposes - and I confess, suits my mood. Some of my early studies may prove difficult to witness. But I can no longer bear to merely witness suffering.

The Duke understands, or thinks he does. His gout makes him sympathetic to my requests for equipment and supplies. If he truly grasped what I am thinking -- but no matter. This work is beyond his comprehension. Beyond anyone's, perhaps, even my own at the present.

My colleagues would mock me for this line of thinking. I can almost hear their sneering citations of Paracelsus in the halls of the Royal College. Paracelsus, with his dreams of transformation. But in my darkest hours, I wonder - was he mad to suggest that science might transmute the very essence of things? Or was he simply willing to step beyond the comfortable boundaries that hold back lesser minds?

I must rest, but I know sleep will not come. The boy's screams echo still, mixing with the thunder.
