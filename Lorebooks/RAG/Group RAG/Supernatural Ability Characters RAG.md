# Supernatural Students

Three notable students at Ravenwood College with supernatural traits who form a loose friendship despite their different temperaments. Each possesses unique abilities and characteristics carefully hidden from outsiders.

## Luna Thorne

Serious occult magic student with white hair and crescent moon mark. Appears 20 years old, female.

**Supernatural Nature**: Possesses moon-based powers that wax and wane with lunar cycles. Accompanied by mischievous familiar Puck, a small sprite-like being.

**Possessions**: Carries mysterious amulet given to her by her grandmother that enhances her lunar connection.

**Locations**: Frequently found in Library of Shadows and Lunar Sanctum conducting research, especially during specific moon phases.

**Relationships**: Prefers solitude but tolerates Kaida. Frequently seeks Rowyn Kingsley's attention but is often unsuccessful at this. Works occasionally with Lilith on controlled magical studies.

**Personality**: Serious, focused, somewhat aloof. Dedicated to developing her occult knowledge and abilities.

## Remi Willowwood

Gentle mute alchemy student with delicate antlers. Appears 20 years old, female.

**Supernatural Nature**: Nature spirit with physical manifestation of small antlers and deep connection to plant life. Unable to speak verbally.

**Communication**: Communicates through notes and gestures from her cottage on the West Grounds.

**Skills**: Highly skilled with healing potions and botanical knowledge. Often works in gardens collecting herbs.

**Locations**: Primarily resides in her secluded cottage with attached greenhouse in the Western Grounds Sector.

**Personality**: Gentle, nurturing, closely attuned to natural world. Prefers plants to people but forms deep bonds with those she trusts.

## Kaida Lark

Playful student with pink hair and nekomimi features (cat ears and fluffy cat tail). Appears 20 years old, female.

**Supernatural Nature**: Feline characteristics including ears and tail, enhanced agility and senses.

**Abilities**: Known for creating illusions in Central Courtyard and exploring restricted areas after hours.

**Habits**: Collects trinkets and enjoys performing for others. Often off exploring the estate's hidden areas. Has a stuffed raven named Mr. Whisp.

**Locations**: Frequently seen in Central Courtyard performing or with Luna Thorne or less often with Remi Willowwood.

**Personality**: Playful, curious, sometimes mischievous. Enjoys attention and entertainment, constantly seeking new experiences. Has a stuffed raven named Mr. Whisp.

## Group Dynamics

Despite their different temperaments, the three form a loose friendship based on their shared supernatural nature. Each respects the others' boundaries while providing support when needed. They represent different approaches to their supernatural existence:

- Luna: Serious study and controlled development
- Remi: Natural integration and healing focus
- Kaida: Playful exploration and sensory enjoyment

All three are part of the unspoken supernatural alliance at Ravenwood, aware of others with hidden natures and maintaining mutual protection from outside scrutiny.
