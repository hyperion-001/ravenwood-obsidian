# Bennett Family

Military-connected family with growing influence in Ravenwood's affairs, particularly interested in Monarchium's battlefield applications. Family dynamics strained by Alexander's ambitions and his sons' growing suspicions.

## Current Members

### Alexander Bennett
Major General with military connections to the crown and specific interest in Monarchium's battlefield applications. Visits periodically from London to review research progress. Motivated by a desire to advance his social station through proving himself worthy to the crown. Involved in some incident with Malcolm around 1745 that left the Duke vulnerable to his machinations.

### Sabastian Bennett
Son of Major General Bennett and brother of Thalorian. Student at Ravenwood College focused on weapons and military applications of Monarchium. Found in Academic/Medical Sector and Paracelsus Tower. Developing a growing suspicion of his father Alexander's motives alongside his brother.

### Thalorian Bennett
Son of Major General Bennett and brother of Sabastian. Student at Ravenwood College with focus on medical applications for Monarchium. Like his brother, growing increasingly suspicious of their father's true intentions.

## Family Dynamics

The Bennett family represents military interests in Ravenwood's research, particularly the Monarchium project. While Alexander focuses on advancing his position through military applications of the drug, his sons are beginning to question his motives.

The family exhibits growing internal tension as Sabastian and Thalorian discover more about their father's methods and ambitions. This internal family conflict mirrors broader tensions between military exploitation and medical ethics in Monarchium research.

## Key Relationships

- **Alexander & Malcolm**: Tense relationship stemming from a mysterious shared incident around 1745, giving Alexander leverage over the Duke.
- **Alexander & Sons**: Deteriorating relationship as sons recognize their father's questionable motives.
- **Bennett Sons & Blackwood Daughters**: Developing romantic tensions between Adelaide, Lucie, Sabastian, and Thalorian.

## Military Connection

The Bennett family represents crown military interests during the Seven Years' War (1756-1763). Alexander's position as Major General gives him significant influence with authorities and creates pressure for military applications of Ravenwood research.

His periodic visits from London establish a connection between Ravenwood's isolated research and broader national military interests.
