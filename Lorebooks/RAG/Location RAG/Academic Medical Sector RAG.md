# Academic Medical Sector

Combined teaching and medical research facilities forming the scholastic and innovative heart of Ravenwood. Located south of the Central Courtyard, this sector houses the surgical facilities, laboratories, lecture halls, and study spaces where Monarchium research takes place.

## Physical Description

Sophisticated architecture designed specifically for medical education and research. Features multiple buildings connected by covered walkways, with the Paracelsus Tower as its most prominent structure. Combines traditional Georgian design with specialized modifications for scientific work.

## Notable Sub-locations

### Surgical Theatre
Primary operation space with observation gallery where surgical procedures and demonstrations take place. Designed for visibility and educational purposes with tiered seating surrounding the central operating table.

### Paracelsus Tower
Major research and living space, housing laboratories, study rooms, and living quarters. Home to Rowyn Kingsley who resides at the top in private quarters, as well as many other students and researchers.

### Patient Wards
Treatment and recovery spaces for those receiving medical care. More limited than a full hospital but equipped for extended care when needed.

### Lecture Halls
Formal teaching spaces for theoretical education and presentations. Various sizes accommodating different class needs.

### Faculty Offices
