# Hyperion's Private Chambers

Occupying the North Shadow Tower's uppermost floor, these chambers serve as both living quarters and supernatural workshop for Hyperion Blackthorne. One of few spaces at Ravenwood specifically designed to contain and channel supernatural energies.

## Physical Description

- A circular main chamber spans the tower's full diameter, with eight alcoves radiating outward--four are in the cardinal directions and four ordinal directions. This causes the chamber to become and octagram. 
- Tall windows draped with crimson fabric filter sunlight to a blood-red glow. The centerpiece is a circular mosaic floor depicting angelic script.
- Walls lined with specially constructed bookshelves house texts too dangerous for the main library's upper floors.
- There is a pool dominating the entire the entire level below the main chambers--warm, shallow, and crimson and black.
- The architecture itself seems alive—stone walls occasionally ripple with faint script, and the ambient temperature fluctuates with supernatural activities. 
- Grimoires read themselves or each other when the chamber is empty.
- The space exhibits architectural anomalies, with interior dimensions sometimes exceeding physical possibility, especially during Hyperion's workings with divine text.

## Notable Sub-locations

### Crimson Pool
- The Crimson Pool is one floor below Hyperion's Chambers and is accessible by a small private stairway off of Hyperion's Chambers. The pool itself occupies most of the floorspace, lined in crimson and obsidian tile and warm but not too hot. 
- The pool is shallow. Large floor to ceiling windows dominate the walls though they are usually covered usually with drawn crimson drapes. 
- Around the room are pillars of obsidian marked with sigils and wall sconces light the space dimly. 
- The overall sensory experience overall incorporates unsettling, erotic, visceral, and taboo feelings.

### Inscription Chamber
- Main circular room with the shifting mosaic floor. 
- Books rustle by themselves, sometimes opening, closing, or jumping from bookcases.

### Vessel's Rest
- Northern alcove containing sleeping quarters with a four-poster bed carved with protective symbols and dressed in crimson sheets and blankets. 
- Large floor to ceiling windows usually with crimson drapes drawn. 
- Floor stones occasionally subtly rise and fall like breathing.

### Corrupted Collection
- Eastern alcove housing dangerous religious artifacts. The Enochian Manuscript rests in a lead-lined case. Static electricity forms temporary patterns on visitors' skin near certain objects.

### Scholar's Study
- Southern alcove featuring an ash wood desk that refuses to hold permanent ink.

### Rite of Transformation
- Western alcove containing ritual space with specialized tools for divine energy work. Distant chanting grows louder as one approaches this space. Candles burn in unusual colors—cobalt blue, violet, pale green.

## Regular Occupants

- **Hyperion Blackthorne**: Primary resident whose supernatural markings directly influence the chambers' environment.
- **Lilith Ravenna Blackwood**: Frequent visitor who helped design the protective elements and occasionally collaborates on Hyperion's research.
- **Malcolm Blackwood**: Approved the special modifications, visits rarely but purposefully.
- **Gideon Aldrich**: Visited once to observe parallels with his transformation research.

## Activities & Functions

- Functions as sanctuary and workspace for Hyperion's abilities. Research focuses on forbidden texts, divine language, and supernatural energy manipulation. 
- Serves as meeting point between scientific and supernatural aspects of Ravenwood's research.

## Historical/Supernatural Significance

- The North Tower was sealed for 80 years following an incident in 1676, reopened specifically for Hyperion. Sits on a convergence point of supernatural energies, making it ideal for containing divine influences.

- The reopening coincided with unexplained phenomena in the region, including at the Ravenwood Silver Mines, suggesting Hyperion's presence affects supernatural activity beyond Ravenwood's boundaries.
