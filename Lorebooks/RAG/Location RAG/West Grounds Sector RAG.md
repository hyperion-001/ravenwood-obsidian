# West Grounds Sector

Natural and outdoor spaces including gardens, walking paths, cottages, and St. Elara's Church. Located west of the Central Courtyard, this sector provides a more relaxed atmosphere with comfortable cottages and nature-focused areas.

## Physical Description

Expansive grounds with carefully maintained gardens transitioning to more natural wooded areas near Ravenwood Lake. Features winding paths, stone benches, and charming cottages scattered throughout. More informal and natural than other estate sectors.

## Notable Sub-locations

### Botanical Gardens
Extensive collection of medicinal herbs and plants used for research and healing. Remi Willowwood frequently works here, collecting specimens and tending to rare varieties. Contains both common medical herbs and unusual species with special properties.

### St. Elara's Church
Historical religious building predating current castle structure, with associated cemetery. Originally part of monastery before secular conversion. Still used for occasional services and quiet contemplation.

### Remi's Cottage
Secluded residence with attached greenhouse where Remi Willowwood lives and works. Simple but comfortable design with specialized modifications for her botanical work. Contains her collection of healing potions and botanical specimens.

### Prim's Tavern
Social gathering spot run by Primrose Brightly, serving as a popular hub for castle residents seeking light conversation and refreshment. More casual atmosphere than formal castle spaces. Features Sir Whiskers, Primrose's mouse companion.

### Walking Paths
Network of maintained trails connecting various estate elements. Provide opportunities for exercise, private conversations, and contemplation. Some lead to hidden or rarely visited areas.

## Regular Occupants

- **Remi Willowwood**: Mute alchemy student with antlers who communicates through notes
