# Ravenwood Lake

Substantial body of water near the castle, crescent-shaped with varying depth and surrounding woodlands. Connected via tributary to the Coquet river. Located immediately west of Ravenwood Estate. Cliffs comprise its eastern shore.

## Physical Description

Crescent-shaped body of water with varying depths, from shallow edges to surprisingly deep central areas. Surrounded by woodlands on most sides with Ravenwood Estate perched on the cliffs of its eastern shore. Surface appears normal but connects to unusual underground water systems.

## Underground Connections

Connected to underground water systems beneath the estate, with passages eventually traveling to the Ravenwood Silver Mines. Val Blackfin has extensive knowledge of these waterways but keeps his secrets. These subterranean waterways remain largely unmapped and may connect to broader water systems including routes to the Northumberland Coast.

## Notable Features

### Val's Quarters
Luxurious chambers built into the cliff face with direct access to the lake. Specially designed for Val Blackfin's marine heritage, these quarters include underwater entrances and specialized environments that accommodate his unique needs.

### Underground Inlet
Cave-like inlet at the bottom of the cliff. Provides provides water and supply delivery access to the castle from the lake and between the lake and subterranean waterways running all the way to the Silver Mines. Commonly used day-to-day by the castle for receiving supplies from the river Coquet.

### Unusual Properties
The lake is rumored to have unusual properties, potentially connected to the Chrysalis Stone's influence on the estate (possibly cobalt and arsenic contamination). These may include unusual aquatic life, strange reflective qualities during certain moon phases, or waters with subtle healing properties.

## Practical Uses

- Primary source of water for the estate
- Fishing for estate consumption
- Connection to Coquet river major waterway for major supplies
- Transport via small-medium boats
- Connection point to wider waterways via underground systems
- Recreational uses for residents

## Supernatural Aspects

The lake serves as a natural connection to Val Blackfin's marine heritage and may harbor other supernatural elements not fully documented. The unusual depth and underground connections suggest potential hidden areas or resources beneath its surface.

## Historical Significance

Present since the estate's founding and likely influenced the original selection of the site for settlement. May have played a role in early monastery activities and potentially connected to prehistoric usage of the Chrysalis Stone.
