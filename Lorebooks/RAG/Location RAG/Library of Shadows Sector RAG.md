# Library of Shadows Sector

Ancient repository of knowledge located east of the Central Courtyard. A sprawling complex housing one of England's most comprehensive private collections, including dangerous and forbidden knowledge. Under Lilith Blackwood's careful stewardship.

## Physical Description

Dominated by the main library building shaped like an octogram with connected towers and specialized sections. Architecture combines ancient monastery elements with later additions. Features multiple levels with restricted and non-restricted areas, reading rooms, and research spaces.

## Notable Sub-locations

- **Main Library Complex**: Central collection with multiple reading rooms and research spaces
- **North Shadow Tower**: Hyperion's domain with specialized occult areas, connected to main library complex via private stairway
- **South Shadow Tower**: Lilith's personal domain and most restricted area
- **Lunar Sanctum**: Luna's preferred space, especially during moon phases

## Access & Control

Access to various sections based on trust and authorization from Lilith. Most dangerous and forbidden knowledge kept in highly restricted areas, particularly the South Shadow Tower. Rumors of a legendary section below the visible library containing the most dangerous knowledge.

## Regular Occupants

- **Lilith Ravenna Blackwood**: Immortal head librarian who guards dangerous knowledge
- **Hyperion Blackthorne**: Research scholar with supernatural markings studying forbidden texts
- **Luna Thorne**: Occult magic student frequently conducting research
- **Lucie Blackwood**: Duke's daughter with particular interest in library collections

## Supernatural Elements

Unusual occurrences including books that appear to have consciousness, texts that appear only when needed, whispers from uninhabited sections, and independent shadow movements. Contains hidden dimensions of reality particularly accessible in deeper sections.

## Historical Significance

Includes collection from former monastery that existed before secular control. Ongoing curation and expansion under Lilith's direction, with particular focus on medical, alchemical, and philosophical works that might be censored or destroyed elsewhere.
