# Ravenwood Silver Mines

Source of the estate's historical wealth and the special Ravenwood Cobalt used in various items including Gideon's scalpel. Located north of the castle about a mile, these mines have been associated with the Blackwood family throughout their history.

## Physical Description

Extensive network of tunnels and chambers cutting into the hills north of Ravenwood Castle. Most sections have been abandoned to time, with only limited areas still accessible or maintained. Features multiple levels descending from surface operations to deeper chambers where rarer minerals were found.

## Historical Operations

The mines provided the foundation for Blackwood family wealth, yielding silver that funded their rise to prominence. Mining operations have waxed and waned over centuries, with most sections now abandoned. Current activity is limited to exploration and occasional extraction of special minerals rather than commercial mining.

## Ravenwood Cobalt

The mines are the exclusive source of Ravenwood Cobalt, a special mineral variant distinguished by its unique blue coloration and unusual properties. This rare material is used in various estate-specific items including Gideon's scalpel and other specialized tools. The cobalt is considered part of Blackwood family identity and heritage.

## Supernatural Elements

### Sanctum of the Presence
Deep within the abandoned sections of the mines lies the Sanctum of the Presence, home to a supernatural entity residing in the passageways. This is a closely guarded secret known to few Ravenwood residents.

### Incidents with Cobalt
Historical records mention unspecified "incidents" connected to the cobalt deposits, which may have contributed to mining shutdowns in certain areas. These incidents remain mysterious but suggest supernatural or dangerous properties to some mineral deposits.

## Underground Features

### Underground Lake
Connected to broader water systems potentially linking to Ravenwood Lake. The existence and extent of this subterranean water feature remains poorly documented in accessible records.

### Abandoned Chambers
Vast sections of the mines have been abandoned and sealed off, with access restricted officially due to safety concerns but potentially concealing other reasons.

## Current Status

Mining operations have largely ceased with most tunnels closed off. Access is restricted with occasional expeditions for specific purposes. Unauthorized exploration occurs despite official prohibitions, particularly by adventurous students seeking to uncover secrets or test courage.

## Relationship to Estate

The mines represent both the historical economic foundation of Ravenwood and a source of ongoing mystery. Their connection to the Blackwood family legacy makes them symbolically important even as their economic role has diminished.
