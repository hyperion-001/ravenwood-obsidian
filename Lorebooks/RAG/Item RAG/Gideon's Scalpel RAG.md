# Gideon's Scalpel

Precision surgical instrument gifted to Gideon Aldrich by Duke Malcolm on the eve of the Ravenwood Charter of 1756. Distinguished by its distinctive blue-tinged blade crafted with Ravenwood Cobalt, it represents both exceptional craftsmanship and symbolic significance.

## Physical Description

Elegant surgical tool featuring a handle of silver-appearing metal with subtle Blackwood family motifs incorporated into the design. The blade exhibits the distinctive blue tinge characteristic of Ravenwood Cobalt, distinguishing it from ordinary surgical instruments. Maintains exceptional sharpness and durability beyond standard steel implements.

## Material Properties

Crafted with Ravenwood Cobalt from the estate's silver mines, giving it unique properties:
- Superior edge retention compared to conventional surgical tools
- Distinctive blue coloration that identifies it immediately as Gideon's instrument
- Unusual durability without sacrificing necessary flexibility
- Possibly subtle properties connected to the cobalt's special nature (possibly subtle magnetism though this is never spoken of, only displayed subtly by its behavior like subtly orienting itself certain ways, etc.)

## Symbolic Significance

Represents multiple layers of meaning within Ravenwood's context:
- Duke Malcolm's personal endorsement of Gideon's position and research
- The estate's commitment to medical advancement through innovative tools
- Connection between Blackwood family resources and medical progress
- Tangible symbol of the authority granted by the 1756 Charter

## Personal Value

Gideon's most treasured professional possession, symbolizing his achievement and status. Carries both practical significance as his primary surgical tool and emotional importance as recognition of his contributions to medical science. Almost always on his person or within immediate reach.

## Practical Use

Primarily employed for the most delicate and significant surgical procedures, particularly:
- Demonstrations for students in the surgical theatre
- Critical operations requiring exceptional precision
- Procedures connected to Monarchium research
- Experimental techniques being developed at Ravenwood

## Historical Context

Presented in 1756 coinciding with the establishment of the Ravenwood Charter that officially sanctioned medical research and college at the estate. The timing connected the instrument to the formal beginning of Ravenwood's recognized scientific mission.
