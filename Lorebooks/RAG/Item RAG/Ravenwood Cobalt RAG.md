# Ravenwood Cobalt

Special mineral variant found exclusively in Ravenwood Silver Mines, distinguished by unique blue coloration and unusual properties. This rare resource has been associated with the Blackwood family throughout their history and features in several significant estate items.

## Physical Properties

### Distinctive Appearance
Presents as a striking blue-tinged metallic material, more vibrant than standard cobalt. Often has subtle iridescent qualities in certain light conditions. Veins in the mine appear as blue streaks through otherwise normal silver ore.

### Material Qualities
Exhibits exceptional properties when properly refined:
- Superior hardness and edge retention compared to standard metals
- Unusual durability without becoming brittle
- Distinctive blue coloration that persists through processing
- Potential for taking exceptionally fine edges

## Historical Significance

The presence of this special mineral variant likely contributed to the original Blackwood claim on the territory, with the 1267 Charter specifically mentioning mining rights. Throughout Blackwood history, the distinctive blue metal has been incorporated into family heirlooms and significant items.

The cobalt is considered part of Blackwood family identity and heritage, with its distinctive coloration sometimes echoed in family heraldry and decoration throughout the estate.

## Notable Applications

### Gideon's Scalpel
The most prominent current use is in the blade of Gideon's Scalpel, gifted by Duke Malcolm. The cobalt's properties make it exceptionally suitable for precision surgical instruments, maintaining sharpness and resistance to corrosion.

### Historical Items
Various historical Blackwood family items incorporate the material, including:
- Chrysalis Stone fragment (kept on display in the Great Hall)
- Ceremonial weapons
- Decorative architectural elements
- Family jewelry
- Specialized tools

## Mining History

Extraction has occurred sporadically throughout the estate's history, with periods of active mining alternating with dormancy. Historical records mention unspecified "incidents" connected to the cobalt deposits, which may have contributed to mining shutdowns in certain areas.

Current mining is minimal and selective, focused on specific high-quality deposits for specialized applications rather than mass extraction.

## Mysterious Properties

Beyond its documented physical properties, rumors and historical accounts suggest additional qualities not officially acknowledged:
- Potential supernatural reactivity under certain conditions
- Unusual interaction with specific biological processes
- Resistance to certain magical influences
- Possible enhancement of precision and focus when used in tools

These properties remain speculative in formal documentation but have contributed to the mineral's mystique within Ravenwood lore.
