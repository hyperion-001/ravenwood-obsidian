# Ravenwood Charters

Official royal documents establishing and maintaining Blackwood authority over Ravenwood Estate and its operations. These legal instruments provide the foundation for both territorial control and research activities.

## Ravenwood Charter of 1756

Official royal document establishing Ravenwood's authority as a medical research institution with special privileges and protections. This modern charter created the legal framework for innovative medical research under Gideon Aldrich's direction.

### Historical Context
Signed during the early years of the Seven Years' War with implicit understanding regarding potential military applications for medical research. The timing connects Ravenwood's research mandate to broader national interests during a period of global conflict.

### Legal Provisions
Provides specific legal framework for research activities including those that might be questioned elsewhere. Includes exemptions from certain regulations that might otherwise restrict medical experimentation, anatomical study, or drug development.

### Associated Figures
Philip Yorke, 1st Earl of Hardwicke, is historically connected to Ravenwood College's legal standing through this charter. His involvement provided political protection and legitimacy to the institution's formation.

### Physical Description
Formal document with royal seals and signatures, preserved in Castle Proper Sector archives. Displayed on significant occasions as symbol of Ravenwood's official standing and authority.

## Ravenwood Charter of 1267

Original historic charter establishing Blackwood family authority over Ravenwood lands and resources. This foundational document provides the legal basis for the family's continuous control of the territory since medieval times.

### Historical Context
Signed during the reign of Henry III, this charter granted lands and rights to the Blackwood family ancestors, establishing their noble standing and territorial authority.

### Legal Provisions
Includes specific rights regarding mining, justice, and local governance that continue to influence estate operations in the current era. These medieval grants have evolved through legal tradition but remain fundamentally intact.

### Physical Condition
Original parchment preserved through careful conservation efforts, showing age but remaining legible. Kept in Castle Proper Sector archives as one of the family's most treasured possessions.

## Legal Significance

Together, these charters provide complementary legal foundations for Ravenwood's operations:
- Territorial authority through hereditary noble rights
- Research authority through crown-sanctioned medical mandate
- Judicial and governance rights within estate boundaries
- Special exemptions for scientific and medical activities

These documents represent not just legal authority but the historical continuity of Blackwood family control over Ravenwood and its evolution from simple territorial holding to center of medical innovation.
