# Estate Secrets
Ravenwood Estate harbors numerous secrets and unexplored areas, providing opportunities for discovery and adventure. These hidden elements range from physical locations to concealed knowledge and mysterious phenomena.

## Hidden Experiments

Secret development of Monarchium applications beyond sanctioned research, particularly exploring non-medical uses and addiction potential. These unsanctioned experiments are conducted in restricted areas with limited oversight, particularly in the east tower of the castle.

Potential discoveries include:
- Underground laboratory facilities
- Unauthorized test subjects
- Documentation of forbidden applications
- Evidence of addiction studies

## Library of Shadows Depths

Legendary section rumored to exist below the visible library containing the most dangerous knowledge. Access is extremely limited with most residents unaware of its existence. Lilith carefully controls knowledge of this area and permits entry only under exceptional circumstances {HIGH AFFINITY}.

This hidden repository may contain:
- Transformation rituals similar to what Lilith used
- Knowledge considered too dangerous even for restricted sections
- Historical accounts of supernatural events at Ravenwood
- Secrets of Blackwood family lineage

## Castle Secrets

Hidden passages, concealed rooms, and architectural mysteries throughout Ravenwood Castle, some dating back to original construction and others added during various renovations.

Notable hidden elements include:
- Secret passages connecting family quarters to escape routes
- Observation points overlooking public areas
- Hidden storage spaces for valuable or dangerous items
- Concealed meeting rooms for private conversations

## Silver Mine Mysteries

The abandoned sections of Ravenwood Silver Mines contain numerous secrets beyond their historical mining purpose:

### Sanctum of the Presence
Deep within the passageways resides a supernatural entity, though this is a closely guarded secret known to few. The nature, purpose, and history of this presence remains mysterious.

### Underground Lake
A subterranean body of water connected to broader water systems, possibly linking to Ravenwood Lake. This hidden feature may harbor unique aquatic life or supernatural properties.

### Cobalt Incidents
Historical incidents with the special Ravenwood Cobalt led to mining shutdowns in certain areas. The exact nature of these events remains obscured in available records.

## Chrysalis Stone Lore

Folklore surrounding the Chrysalis Stone suggests deeper significance beyond its known healing properties:
- Possible origin predating human settlement
- Connection to supernatural properties of the estate
- Potential for activation beyond its passive influence
- Fragments potentially hidden throughout the estate

## Supernatural Boundaries

The unspoken understanding among those with hidden natures creates opportunities to discover the full extent of supernatural presence at Ravenwood:
- Progressive revelation of abilities among trusted individuals
- Secret gatherings or rituals
- Hidden training or development of powers
- Artifacts enhancing or controlling supernatural traits
