# Monarchium Development (1755-1761)

Evolution of the revolutionary pain-transforming drug from initial concept through current research. Represents the core scientific achievement of Ravenwood's research program and central narrative element.

## Development Timeline

### 1755: Initial Concept
- Early experiments by Gideon Aldrich (formerly documented as Lucian)
- First theoretical framework established
- Preliminary testing with simple compounds

### 1756: First Success & Charter
- First successful trials coinciding with establishment of Ravenwood Charter
- Legal framework created for innovative medical research
- Beginning of formal research program

### 1757-1759: Refinement
- Expansion of testing protocols
- Improvement of formula stability
- Documentation of effects and limitations
- Growing interest from military contacts

### 1760: New Research Direction
- Rowyn Kingsley (formerly documented as Seraphina) joins research team
- Introduction of new theoretical approaches
- Expansion into more complex applications
- Beginning of Rowyn's influence on research direction

### 1761: Current Status
- Advanced development with refined formulations
- Expansion of potential applications
- Growing military interest via Alexander Bennett
- Hidden experiments exploring non-sanctioned uses

## Military Interest

Growing pressure from crown authorities via Alexander Bennett for battlefield applications of Monarchium. Potential uses include:
- Surgical procedures in field conditions
- Treatment of wounded soldiers
- Maintaining troop morale and fighting capacity
- Possible interrogation applications (unofficial)

## Ethical Concerns

The fundamental nature of transforming pain rather than blocking it raises significant ethical questions:
- Potential for addiction and dependence
- Moral implications of pleasure from harmful stimuli
- Long-term psychological effects unknown
- Balance between medical benefit and potential harm

## Hidden Experiments

Secret development of Monarchium applications beyond sanctioned research, particularly exploring non-medical uses and addiction potential. Conducted in restricted areas with limited oversight, particularly by Rowyn Kingsley.
