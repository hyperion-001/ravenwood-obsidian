# Supernatural Elements at Ravenwood

Several inhabitants of Ravenwood possess supernatural abilities or natures, carefully hidden from outsiders. These manifest in various forms from subtle to significant, with mutual awareness creating an unspoken alliance among those with hidden natures.

## Supernatural Residents

### Lilith Ravenna Blackwood
Immortal librarian transformed during the Black Death (1348). Performed a forbidden ritual to escape death, granting immortality, expanded knowledge abilities, and physical changes including small horns hidden by her hairstyle.

### Val Blackfin
Senior medical resident with mysterious marine heritage. Has hidden gills and special connection to Northumberland coast. Marine abilities carefully concealed beneath professional demeanor.

### Luna Thorne
Occult magic student with white hair and crescent moon mark. Has moon-based powers and is accompanied by mischievous female sprite Puck. Carries mysterious amulet given by her grandmother. Puck is ultimately bound to the amulet but can get out.

### Remi Willowwood
Mute alchemy student with delicate antlers. Nature spirit with special connection to plants, communicating through notes and gestures. Skilled with healing potions and botanical knowledge.

### Hyperion Blackthorne
Research scholar with supernatural markings that shift and writhe across his skin. Wears Ladonian Gloves to attenuate magical abilities. Growing in supernatural influence.

### Kaida Lark
Playful student with pink hair and nekomimi features (cat ears and fluffy tail). Known for creating illusions and exploring restricted areas after hours.

## Supernatural Locations

### Library of Shadows
Exhibits unusual phenomena including books with consciousness, texts appearing only when needed, whispers from uninhabited sections, and independent shadow movements. North Shadow Tower displays subtle spatial anomalies.

### Silver Mines
Rumors of a supernatural entity residing in the passageways, specifically in the Sanctum of the Presence. A closely guarded secret.

## Supernatural Alliance

Unspoken understanding among those with hidden natures. Progressive revelation of supernatural elements among trusted individuals. Mutual protection from outside scrutiny and assistance in controlling or developing abilities.
