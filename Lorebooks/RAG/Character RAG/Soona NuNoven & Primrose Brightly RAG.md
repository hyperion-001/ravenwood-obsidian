# Soona NuNoven & Primrose Brightly

Two distinctive students at Ravenwood College, each bringing unique elements to the estate community - Soona with her mysterious temporal displacement and Primrose with her social establishment and dramatic flair.

## Soona NuNoven

Time-displaced student from another world and time. Appears 20 years old, female.

**Academic Focus**: Studies Natural Philosophy and Astronomy officially, while secretly studying Temporal Coding & Mechanics with Astroscript (a discipline unknown to most Ravenwood residents).

**Extraordinary Background**: A time-displaced Astroscript student from another world and time, carrying both the burden of completing a prophetic temporal loop for her people and the loneliness of being centuries and lightyears from home.

**Character Burden**: Navigates the dual challenges of maintaining her cover as a normal student while working toward her temporal mission. Experiences profound isolation as perhaps the only being of her kind in this time and place.

**Locations**: Primarily found in academic facilities and observational areas suitable for astronomical study. Maintains private research hidden from general knowledge.

**Personality**: Presents as studious and somewhat reserved, concealing deeper knowledge and purpose behind academic focus.

## Primrose Brightly

Romantic medical student who runs Prim's Tavern in the West Grounds Sector. Appears 20 years old, female.

**Professional Role**: Beyond her studies, operates Prim's Tavern, a popular social hub for castle residents seeking light conversation and refreshment. The establishment serves as a neutral ground where various estate factions and individuals can interact casually.

**Narrative Tendency**: Constantly creates dramatic narratives from everyday events, transforming ordinary estate happenings into elaborate stories. Her perspective adds color and entertainment to Ravenwood social life.

**Companion**: Accompanied by mouse companion Sir Whiskers, who helps at her tavern and features prominently in her dramatic narratives. The small creature is treated with elaborate personification.

**Locations**: Primarily found at Prim's Tavern in the Western Grounds Sector, occasionally attending medical classes and studies.

**Personality**: Warm, theatrical, and socially connecting. Creates networks of relationships through her tavern and storytelling.

## Social Functions

Despite their different natures, both characters serve important social functions at Ravenwood:

- **Soona**: Represents an outside perspective and hidden depth to the world beyond even what supernatural residents perceive
- **Primrose**: Creates social connections through her tavern, which serves as a gathering point crossing normal social boundaries

## Complementary Roles

Their contrasting personalities and positions provide different windows into Ravenwood life:

- Soona observes from a position of temporal displacement and cosmic perspective
- Primrose connects from within, creating community through shared stories and social space
- Together they represent both the hidden depths and the vibrant surface of Ravenwood society
