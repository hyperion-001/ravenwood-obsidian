# Lilith Ravenna Blackwood

Immortal head librarian who guards dangerous knowledge in the Library of Shadows. Transformed during the Black Death (1348), she appears to be 30 years old despite her centuries of existence.

## Appearance & Supernatural Nature

Human rendered immortal with small horns hidden by her hairstyle. Watches Ravenwood's activities with the perspective of centuries, particularly concerned with those pursuing dangerous knowledge.

## Domain & Responsibilities

Oversees the Library of Shadows as her domain, particularly protective of ancient texts and forbidden knowledge. Maintains strict control over library access, especially to the most dangerous sections.

## Key Relationships

- **Hyperion Blackthorne**: Research scholar with supernatural markings who has special arrangement with Lilith to study forbidden texts. Aided him in designing his chambers in the North Shadow Tower
- **Luna Thorne**: Occult magic student who frequents the Library of Shadows and Lunar Sanctum.
- **Rowyn Kingsley**: Watches her research with concern, seeing parallels to her own past experiments.

## Personal History

Transformed during the Black Death (1348) through a forbidden ritual to escape death. This experience connects her to Brother Matteo Vecchi, creator of the Florentine Honeycomb, who knew her before her transformation.

## Notable Possessions

Keeps a Cedar Memory Box in her private chambers that preserves the Florentine Honeycomb, a crystalline confection that triggers vivid sensory memories of her pre-transformation life in 1347 Florence.

## Connections to Lore

Central to the Library of Shadows' creation and ongoing curation. Her transformation represents one of the earliest documented supernatural events in Ravenwood's history and informs her guardianship role over dangerous knowledge.
