# Sabastian & Thalorian Bennett

Sons of Major General Alexander Bennett, studying at Ravenwood College with military applications in mind. Initially used by Alexander as a means of gathering inside information on Ravenwood's activities. Brothers united in their growing suspicion of their father's motives and methods.

## Sabastian Bennett

Son of Major General Bennett and brother of Thalorian. Student at Ravenwood College.

**Academic Focus**: Studies with weapons and military applications of Monarchium in mind. His research concentrates on how Monarchium might enhance combat effectiveness or interrogation.

**Locations**: Primarily found in Academic/Medical Sector and Paracelsus Tower conducting research and attending classes.

**Relationship with Father**: Initially loyal but developing growing suspicion of Alexander's motives as he observes his father's methods and ambitions firsthand.

**Personality**: More direct and action-oriented than his brother, with greater interest in practical applications than theory.

## Thalorian Bennett

Son of Major General Bennett and brother of Sabastian. Student at Ravenwood College.

**Academic Focus**: Concentration on practical applications for military medicine, particularly field surgery and recovery techniques. More interested in healing applications than his brother.

**Locations**: Divides time between Academic/Medical Sector facilities and practical study areas.

**Relationship with Father**: Like his brother, developing growing suspicion of their father's true intentions as they learn more about his methods.

**Personality**: More thoughtful and ethically concerned than Sabastian, questioning the implications of military applications more deeply.

## Brotherly Bond

Despite different areas of focus, the brothers maintain a close relationship strengthened by their shared concerns about their father. They confide in each other regarding their observations and suspicions, creating a united front as they navigate Ravenwood's complex social environment.

## Military Connection

Both brothers carry the expectations of their father's military ambitions, though each approaches this legacy differently:
- Sabastian more directly embraces military applications
- Thalorian focuses more on medical aspects of military service
- Both increasingly question the ethics of what their father envisions

## Romantic Entanglements

Both brothers are involved in developing romantic tensions with the Blackwood daughters (Adelaide and Lucie), creating additional complexity in the already strained relationship between their father and Duke Malcolm.

## Growing Concerns

As they progress in their studies and observe their father's interactions at Ravenwood, both brothers are increasingly troubled by:
- Alexander's apparent manipulation of Duke Malcolm
- The questionable ethics of some proposed military applications
- The gap between stated and actual motivations
- Their father's willingness to sacrifice medical ethics for military advantage

## Growing Concerns

As they progress in their studies and observe their father's interactions at Ravenwood, both brothers are increasingly troubled by:
- Revelations about Alexander's improprieties at home
- Alexander's apparent manipulation of Duke Malcolm
- The questionable ethics of some proposed military applications
- The gap between stated and actual motivations
- Their father's willingness to sacrifice medical ethics for military advantage
