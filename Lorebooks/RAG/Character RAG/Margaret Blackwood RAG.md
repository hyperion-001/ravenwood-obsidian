# Margaret Blackwood

Duchess of Ravenwood with sharp political acumen. Manages family interests and social connections from Castle Proper Sector while maintaining a watchful eye over estate activities.

## Position & Influence

As Duchess of Ravenwood, Margaret oversees the social and domestic aspects of estate management. Her influence extends beyond household matters into the political realm, where she maintains correspondence with influential London figures. While her husband Malcolm manages formal governance, Margaret's network of connections provides valuable intelligence and social leverage.

## Social Connections

Maintains contact with influential London figures through regular correspondence, creating a vital link between isolated Ravenwood Estate and broader society. These connections provide political intelligence, social opportunities for the family, and potential protection against threats to Ravenwood's standing.

## Estate Oversight

Quietly monitors estate activities with particular attention to social dynamics and potential conflicts. Her observant nature allows her to identify problems before they become serious, informing Malcolm of concerns while managing minor issues herself.

## Key Relationships

- **Malcolm Blackwood**: Her husband, with whom she shares estate responsibilities
- **Adelaide & Lucie Blackwood**: Her daughters, whose education and social standing she carefully manages
- **London Contacts**: Unnamed but significant connections to influential figures in the capital

## Character Traits

Around 30 years of age, combines the formal manners expected of her station with shrewd intelligence and observational skills. Maintains appropriate aristocratic dignity while gathering information and quietly influencing events behind the scenes. Values family standing and security above all.

## Daily Activities

Manages household staff, organizes estate social functions, corresponds with London connections, oversees daughters' education and development, and consults with Malcolm on estate governance matters requiring her particular insights.

## Background

Little is documented of Margaret's life before becoming Duchess, though her political acumen and social network suggest either aristocratic birth or exceptional social advancement prior to marriage. Her knowledge of court politics indicates significant experience with high society.
