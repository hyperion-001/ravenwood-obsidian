# Hyperion Blackthorne

Research scholar with supernatural markings that shift and writhe across his skin, usually creating messages in various languages. Appears to be around 30 years old, male, with an intense focus on forbidden knowledge and carefully controlled supernatural abilities.

## Appearance & Supernatural Nature

Distinguished by supernatural markings that shift and move across his body, appearing almost like living text or symbols. These markings react to magical energies and certain types of knowledge, sometimes glowing or changing patterns in response to stimuli.

## Special Arrangement

Studies forbidden texts in Library of Shadows with a special arrangement with Lilith. One of the few individuals granted access to particularly dangerous knowledge due to both his scholarly credentials and Lilith's assessment of his potential (though she maintains a close eye).

## Supernatural Control

Wears Ladonian Gloves to attenuate his magical abilities and control supernatural markings. These elegant gloves allow him to interact with certain texts and materials that would otherwise react strongly to his supernatural nature. Without them, his abilities can manifest in unpredictable and potentially dangerous ways.

## Domain & Research

Primarily operates in the North Shadow Tower of the Library complex, which has become his personal domain through arrangement with Lilith Ravenna Blackwood. His research focuses on forbidden knowledge with particular attention to transformation, magical containment, and reality manipulation.

## Key Relationships

- **Lilith Ravenna Blackwood**: Primary relationship at Ravenwood. She supervises his access to dangerous texts with caution though she recognizes his scholarly value.

- **Other Supernatural Residents**: Part of the unspoken alliance among those with hidden natures, though his specific abilities make him somewhat distinct even in this group.

## Character Development

Noted to be "growing in supernatural influence" as his research progresses and his control over his abilities develops. This increasing power makes his approach and reactivity to compromising situations particularly important to Ravenwood's stability.

## Background

Little is documented about Hyperion's life before Ravenwood or the origin of his supernatural markings. His formal scholarly credentials and Lilith's willingness to grant him special access suggest both academic accomplishment and trustworthy character despite his unusual nature.
