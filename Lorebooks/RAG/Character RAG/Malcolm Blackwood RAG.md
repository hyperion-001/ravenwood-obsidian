# Malcolm Blackwood

Duke of Ravenwood and noble patron of medical research. Oversees the estate from Castle Proper Sector while maintaining political connections with crown authorities. The current head of the historic Blackwood lineage.

## Position & Authority

As Duke of Ravenwood, Malcolm sits at the top of the estate's authority structure. His family has maintained continuous ownership since the 13th century, with Malcolm representing the latest in an unbroken line of Blackwood leadership. His authority is formally recognized through both the historical Ravenwood Charter of 1267 and the more recent Ravenwood Charter of 1756.

## Personal Motivations

Has a personal interest in pain management due to a chronic arthritic condition or war injury (specifics not fully documented). This personal connection to medical suffering informs his patronage of Gideon Aldrich's research and the development of Monarchium.

## Key Relationships

- **Margaret Blackwood**: His wife, the Duchess, who manages family interests and social connections
- **Adelaide & Lucie Blackwood**: His daughters, both students at Ravenwood College
- **Gideon Aldrich**: Master Surgeon whom he frequently consults about research progress
- **Alexander Bennett**: Maintains a tense relationship stemming from a mysterious shared incident around 1745 that left Malcolm vulnerable to Bennett's machinations

## Political Considerations

Balances supporting the Seven Years' War effort as a loyal subject against protecting Ravenwood's primary medical research mission. This balancing act is complicated by his personal vulnerability to Alexander Bennett, creating an undercurrent of tension in estate governance.

## Character Traits

Projects nobility and authority expected of his station while harboring private concerns about both his health and Bennett's influence. Shows genuine interest in medical advancement, not merely for political advantage but from personal investment in pain management solutions.

## Historical Note

Malcolm's vulnerability to Alexander Bennett stems from an incident around 1745, the details of which remain mysterious but create significant leverage that Bennett exploits in their relationship. This private history influences many of Malcolm's decisions regarding military access to Ravenwood research.
