# Ravenwood Setting Overview

**Setting:** Ravenwood Estate (castle and grounds), Northumberland, England, 1755-1762  
**Current Year:** 1761  
**Genre:** Historical fantasy, gothic horror, medical horror

## Core Narrative

In 1761 at the isolated Ravenwood Castle, a brilliant but ruthless surgical apprentice's obsession with transforming pain into pleasure threatens to corrupt both a revolutionary medical breakthrough and her own humanity.

## Core Themes

- **The corruption of noble intentions**: How pursuit of good can lead to moral decay
- **The price of forbidden knowledge**: Consequences of pursuing knowledge beyond ethical bounds
- **The nature of transformation**: Physical, mental, and spiritual change and its effects
- **The hubris in ambition**: Pride and arrogance leading to downfall

## World Concepts

### Medical Innovation vs Ethics

Centered on Monarchium, a revolutionary pain-transforming drug that raises questions about the boundaries of medical ethics, particularly in how it transforms pain rather than simply eliminating it.

### Supernatural Elements

Several inhabitants of Ravenwood possess supernatural abilities carefully hidden from outsiders. These manifest in various ways from subtle to significant, with mutual awareness among supernatural beings creating an unspoken alliance.

### Historical Foundation

Set against the backdrop of 1760s medicine and the Seven Years' War (1756-1763), with tensions between traditional approaches and emerging Enlightenment thinking. The war creates pressure for military applications of medical research.

## Estate Structure

Ravenwood Estate is divided into five main sectors:
1. **Central Courtyard Sector** (Center) - Social hub and connecting space
2. **Castle Proper Sector** (North) - Blackwood family residence
3. **Library of Shadows Sector** (East) - Repository of knowledge
4. **Academic/Medical Sector** (South) - Research and education
5. **West Grounds Sector** (West) - Natural spaces and cottages
