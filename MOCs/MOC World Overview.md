# Ravenwood: World Overview

**Setting:** Primarily Ravenwood Estate (including castle and grounds), Northumberland, England, covering the years 1755 - 1762
**Genre:** historical fantasy, gothic horror, medical horror, 18th century period fiction
**Logline:** In 1761 at the isolated Ravenwood Castle, a brilliant but ruthless surgical apprentice's obsession with transforming pain into pleasure threatens to corrupt both a revolutionary medical breakthrough and her own humanity.

## Themes

- **The price of forbidden knowledge:** exploring the moral and personal costs of pushing boundaries
