# Grimoire
*[tagline]*

## General

- **Description:** *Being often anthropomorphized, grimoires often have certain "behaviors"*
	- Books occasionally re-shelf themselves overnight
	- Certain texts seem impossible to find until "needed"	
	- "Keening" when stroked or comforted
	- Acting like the text they contain is too much for them and wanting to "end it all" by throwing themselves off a high bookshelf (which they often do)
	- Things appearing to (or actually) coming out of them: gruesome fingers, ink, arms, tendrils, etc
	- Whispers sometimes heard from uninhabited sections (usually the books talking to themselves)
