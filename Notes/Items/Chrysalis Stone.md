# Chrysalis Stone
*An ancient obsidian boulder veined with [[Ravenwood Cobalt]], said to house a transforming entity*

## General

- **Description:** A massive obsidian-black boulder with dramatic blue-silver veins (Ravenwood cobalt) and pure silver that form a pattern resembling a chrysalis or cocoon. A rugby ball-sized fragment broken during a lightning strike in 1703 is displayed in Ravenwood Castle's Great Hall on a silver pedestal within a specially designed glass case. Both the original stone and the fragment exhibit unusual properties, including subtle shifts in the vein patterns and occasional crystal formations after rainfall.

- **Significance:** The Chrysalis Stone represents the mystical heart of Ravenwood's folklore, connecting the region's mining history with supernatural elements. Its reported ability to transform pain into pleasure may have influenced the development of Monarchium. The stone serves as a physical embodiment of the narrative's transformation theme and hints at ancient knowledge embedded in the land itself.

- **Backstory:** The stone has been a fixture in Northmire since before written records, with the earliest documented mention appearing in monastery records from 1219. Local legends claim it fell from the sky during an ancient meteor shower, bringing the unique Ravenwood cobalt with it. The Blackwood family incorporated the stone into their mythology after establishing Ravenwood in 1267, building their mining operations around its location. After the lightning strike of 1703 that split the fragment, Duke Malcolm's grandfather brought the piece to Ravenwood Castle, where it has remained ever since.

- **Current Owner:** [[Malcolm Blackwood]], though locals consider the stone to belong to the land itself rather than any individual.

## Additional

- **Folklore Elements**
	- **The Transformation Legend** - Local legend claims the stone contains something ancient that is slowly transforming, with the cobalt-silver veins representing its "lifeblood." Every century, the pattern shifts slightly, marking the slow metamorphosis of what lies within.
	
	- **Healing Properties** - Similar to the drake stone in Harbottle, the Chrysalis Stone was used for healing rituals, particularly for pain-related ailments. Touching the stone was said to transform pain into pleasant warmth that spread through the body.
	
	- **The Lightning Pact** - The stone attracts lightning, having been struck numerous times. Each strike is said to "feed" whatever dwells within. Legend claims the Blackwood family made a pact with the entity in the stone, offering it a place within Ravenwood in exchange for its "gifts."
	
	- **The Whispering Stone** - Those who place their ear against the stone during a full moon may hear whispers. Most hear unintelligible murmuring, but some claim to understand warnings or predictions. The castle fragment is said to whisper more clearly than the main stone.
	
	- **The Sleeper's Tears** - Water collecting in depressions on the stone after rainfall is collected by locals for its medicinal properties. It has a faint metallic taste, subtle blue tint, and is particularly prized for treating pain and inflammation.
