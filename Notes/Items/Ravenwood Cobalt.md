# Ravenwood Cobalt
*A unique blue-silver metal found only in the mines of Northmire, known for its unusual properties*

## General

- **Description:** A distinctive metallic substance with a striking blue-silver coloration, most often found in delicate veining patterns throughout the silver ore deposits of the Ravenwood Mines. When extracted and refined, Ravenwood cobalt maintains its characteristic blue sheen while exhibiting the luster and workability of silver. Objects crafted from the metal or its alloys develop a subtle blue luminescence in darkness. The material is notably heavier than common silver and maintains temperature (both hot and cold) significantly longer than ordinary metals.

- **Significance:** Ravenwood cobalt represents the physical foundation of the Blackwood family's wealth and status. Beyond its financial value, the metal serves as a visual motif throughout Ravenwood's architecture and family heirlooms, symbolizing their connection to the land. The unique properties of the metal have contributed to local folklore and possibly to scientific advancements, including Monarchium research. The metal forms the most prominent veins in the Chrysalis Stone, linking it to transformation legends.

- **Backstory:** First discovered in 1312 during standard silver mining operations, Ravenwood cobalt was initially considered a curiosity or contaminant. By 1350, local metallurgists had recognized its unique properties and developed techniques for its refinement and use. The Blackwood family carefully controlled its extraction and distribution, ensuring it remained exclusive to Ravenwood. When mining operations ceased in 1723, existing reserves became increasingly precious, with the family maintaining a private vault of refined cobalt for specific uses. Local folklore suggests the metal is the "lifeblood" of whatever entity sleeps within the Chrysalis Stone.

- **Current Owner:** [[Malcolm Blackwood]] controls the remaining reserves, though small amounts exist in various heirlooms and artifacts throughout the region.

- **Physical Properties**
	1. **Appearance and Coloration:**
	   - Distinct blue-silver coloration, darker than traditional silver
	   - Veins in natural state appear as delicate blue threads through grey stone
	   - Refined metal maintains blue tint while exhibiting silver's reflective properties
	   - Develops subtle iridescence when polished to high sheen
	   - Naturally forms distinctive crystalline patterns when cooling from molten state

	2. **Unusual Characteristics:**
	   - Maintains temperature significantly longer than ordinary metals
	   - Exhibits subtle blue luminescence in complete darkness ([[Witch Glow]])
	   - Produces a clear, resonant tone when struck, with sound sustaining longer than similar metals
	   - Resists tarnishing and oxidation, maintaining luster for generations
	   - Approximately 20% heavier than equivalent volume of silver

	3. **Working Properties:**
	   - Requires higher temperatures for melting (approximately 15% higher than silver)
	   - Can be alloyed with silver for enhanced workability
	   - Takes exceptionally detailed impressions when cast
	   - Extremely durable despite relative softness
	   - Can be drawn into wire finer than any other known metal of the period

- **Uses and Applications**
	1. **Decorative Applications:**
	   - Family jewelry and ceremonial objects
	   - Architectural accents throughout Ravenwood Castle
	   - Inlay work in fine furniture
	   - Illuminated manuscript embellishments
	   - Blackwood family crest elements

	2. **Practical Applications:**
	   - Precision scientific instruments
	   - Medical tools with superior durability - [[Gideon's Scalpel]]
	   - Special keys and locking mechanisms
	   - Duration-sensitive measuring devices
	   - Weather prediction instruments (utilizing temperature retention properties)

	3. **Medicinal/Alchemical Applications:**
	   - Component in certain pain-relieving preparations
	   - Used in specialized surgical tools - [[Gideon's Scalpel]]
	   - Potential ingredient in experimental compounds - [[Monarchium]]
	   - Used to contain volatile substances due to stability
	   - Small amounts sometimes incorporated into healing amulets

- **Folklore and Superstitions**
	1. **The Blue Touch:**
	   Long-term handling of raw cobalt was said to leave a permanent blue tinge on skin, particularly beneath fingernails and in the creases of palms. These "blue-touched" individuals reportedly gained certain abilities, including:
	   - Sensing approaching storms days in advance
	   - Detecting underground water sources
	   - Finding their way in absolute darkness
	   - Recognizing lies when told directly to them
	   - Experiencing unusually vivid dreams
	   - [[Blue Blood Curse]] - More unfavorable interpretation of "The Blue Touch." Condition affecting miners who worked extensively with the metal

	2. **Protective Properties:**
	   Carrying a small piece of worked cobalt-silver was believed to provide protection against:
	   - Severe pain (would be "transformed" to manageable discomfort)
	   - Malicious spirits, particularly those causing nightmares
	   - Getting lost in forests or caves
	   - Poisoning (the metal would allegedly turn black)
	   - Sudden death (would grow cold shortly before fatal danger)

	3. **Truth Metal:**
	   Ravenwood cobalt gained a reputation as "truth metal" due to beliefs that:
	   - It would grow noticeably cold in the presence of deliberate lies
	   - Objects made from it could not be used to swear false oaths
	   - Documents signed with cobalt-infused ink could not contain falsehoods
	   - It would tarnish if used to record historical untruths
	   - Legal scales incorporating the metal would refuse to balance if justice was not served
