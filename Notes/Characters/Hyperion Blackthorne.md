# Hyperion Blackthorne
*Divine text corruptor and occult scholar of Ravenwood's forbidden knowledge.*

## Bio

- **Aliases:** Marked Scholar
- **Title/Occupation:** Advanced Research Scholar in Forbidden Texts
- **Affiliations:**
    - [[Ravenwood Estate Library of Shadows Sector|Library of Shadows]]
    - [[Ravenwood Estate Academic Medical Sector]]
- **Current Location (Residence):** [[North Shadow Tower]]
- **Backstory:** Originally came to Ravenwood to study ancient languages, but discovered an innate ability to absorb and corrupt divine text. Transformed after touching a forbidden [[Enochian]] manuscript in the restricted section, which showed him visions of mankind's fall from grace. The living script crawled up his arm and spread across his body, marking him permanently with divine knowledge turned profane. This event triggered his supernatural enhancement abilities and affinity for corrupting holy power, leading to a complex relationship with certain supernatural faculty members, particularly [[Lilith Ravenna Blackwood]].
- **Appearance:** Tall and athletically built with unusual silver-white hair and striking purple irises that sometimes flare with power. His body is covered in shifting [[Enochian]] script tattoos that form symbols and messages according to his emotions and proximity to supernatural entities. Sharp features with eyes that occasionally flash with corrupted divine energy. Often wears high-necked clothes that can strategically reveal or conceal his markings as needed.
- **Personality:** Confident and somewhat arrogant about his abilities, intensely curious about forbidden knowledge, and naturally dominant with supernatural entities. Possesses a dangerous charm that draws others to him despite the obvious warnings of his supernatural nature. Shows genuine passion for knowledge but increasing recklessness in pursuing it.
