## LILITH BLACKWOOD TRANSFORMATION STORY

### EVENT OVERVIEW

- Transformation Date: 7 February 1348
- Age at Transformation: 34
- Transformation Location: Ravenwood Estate, Northumbria, England
- Transformation Journey:
  - Lilith leaves home in Florence, Italy in October 1347 after plague arrives in Sicily, hoping to find the rumored cure in Northumbria at the Ravenwood Estate.
  - Her journey takes about 3 months, delayed by the spreading plague, fear of travelers, and lack of reliable transportation.
  - She must use various modes of transportation: on foot, horseback, carts, and ships (traveling on rivers and finally crossing the English Channel).
  - She arrives at the Ravenwood Estate in early 1348, spends time searching the records and manuscripts, and finally performs the ritual of transformation on herself in February 1348.
  - After transformation and brief recovery she travels hastily back to Florence, arriving in May 1348 during the height of the plague in Florence.
  - She discovers that she is too late to save her family from the plague.
  - She now enters a period where she cares for the sick and dying, offering transformation where she is able, though many refuse and die.
