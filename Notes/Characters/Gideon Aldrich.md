# Gideon Aldrich 
*Brilliant surgeon whose noble quest to transform pain management gradually becomes corrupted by ambition and the dark potential of his own creation.*

## Bio

- **Aliases:** Master Surgeon of Ravenwood
- **Title/Occupation:** Master Surgeon, Director of Medical Research
- **Affiliations:** 
	- [[Ravenwood Estate]]
	- [[Company of Surgeons]]
	- [[Crown Military Medical Division]]
	- [[Monarchium Development Team]]
	- [[Royal Society]] (limited)

- **Backstory:** 
	- Born to a respectable medical family around 1710-1715, Gideon pursued medical training through formal education and possible military service, though he never directly confirms the latter. His early career was marked by growing frustration with traditional pain management methods, witnessing countless patients suffering through necessary procedures with inadequate relief. After a particularly traumatic surgery on a young boy in 1755, Gideon became obsessed with finding a revolutionary solution to pain management. His vision attracted the attention of [[Malcolm Blackwood]], whose patronage and connections with the Crown resulted in the [[Ravenwood Charter of 1756]]. This official sanction allowed Gideon to establish a proper research institution at Ravenwood Castle, where he developed [[Monarchium]] - a revolutionary compound that transforms pain into pleasure rather than merely dulling sensation. His early humanitarian motivations gradually became complicated by military demands, increasing pressure for results, and eventually by his complex relationship with his brilliant but dangerous apprentice, [[Rowyn Kingsley]].

- **Appearance:** 
	- General Build and Presence:
		- Medium height with a solid, well-proportioned frame suggesting both endurance and control
		- Mid-40s, with dark hair showing touches of gray, kept neatly trimmed
		- Stands with the straight posture of someone with military background, though he never verifies this history when asked
		- A face that appears stern in repose but transforms when engaged in discussion or teaching
	- Facial Features:
		- Perceptive hazel eyes that suggest both analytical thinking and occasional compassion
		- Strong jawline slightly softened by age, giving him a distinguished rather than harsh appearance
		- Slight furrow between his brows that deepens when concerned or concentrating
		- Faint lines around his eyes suggest both years of concentration and occasional humor
		- Clean-shaven, maintained with the same precision he applies to his surgical work
		- Complexion slightly weathered, particularly across the cheekbones, hinting at time spent outdoors earlier in life
	- Hands and Movement:
		- Strong, capable hands with prominent knuckles and a slight permanent stain on his right index finger
		- Long fingers that move with practiced economy—never hurried, never wasteful of motion
		- Habitual gesture of rubbing his thumb against his fingers when thinking, as if testing an invisible fabric
		- Movement pattern that shifts noticeably between casual grace when at ease and focused precision when working
	- Professional Presentation:
		- Tends to dress in darker colors—navy, deep green, browns—practical choices that hide stains
		- Preference for well-constructed clothing of quality wool and linen, tailored but not fashionable
		- Waistcoats of subtly patterned fabrics, typically with extra pockets added by a local tailor
		- Carries a simple silver pocket watch for timing procedures, worn on a leather cord rather than a chain
		- Wears a plain silver ring on his right hand—not ornamental but seemingly kept for sentimental reasons
	- Professional Habits:
		- Habit of straightening his cuffs before beginning any procedure, almost ritualistic in consistency
		- Maintains a small, specially designed case of personal surgical tools kept in immaculate condition
		- Tendency to focus so intently on work that he temporarily forgets his surroundings
		- Keeps detailed notes in a small leather-bound journal with a customized organizational system

- **Personality:** 
	- Primary Traits:
		- Brilliant but obsessive about his work
		- Methodical and precise in every action
		- Initially driven by humanitarian goals that gradually become compromised
		- Idealistic about medical advancement while increasingly blind to ethical concerns

	- Secondary Traits:
		- Natural teacher with genuine desire to pass knowledge
		- Observant of details others miss
		- Patient with those who show true interest
		- Occasionally displays dry, unexpected humor
		- Grows increasingly susceptible to manipulation through his idealism
		- Develops dangerous blind spots regarding [[Rowyn Kingsley]]'s intentions
	- Intellectual Traits:
		- Exceptional analytical capacity
		- Innovative approach to medical problems
		- Combines rigorous methodology with intuitive leaps
		- Cross-disciplinary thinker drawing from chemistry, anatomy, and natural philosophy
		- Remarkable ability to visualize complex biological processes
	- Emotional Patterns:
		- Deeply affected by patient suffering
		- Frequently sublimates emotional responses into work
		- Demonstrates unexpected tenderness toward patients
		- Often detaches professionally to maintain functionality
		- Increasingly vulnerable to emotional manipulation as story progresses
