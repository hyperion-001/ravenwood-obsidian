# Rowyn Kingsley 
*Brilliant and ambitious young woman whose obsession with pain transformation reveals an increasingly ruthless nature and reveals a growing darkness within.*

## Bio

- **Aliases:** Rowyn
- **Age in 1761:** 21
- **Gender:** female
- **Title/Occupation:** Surgical Apprentice at [[Ravenwood Estate]]
- **Affiliations:** 
	- [[Ravenwood Estate Academic Medical Sector]]
	- [[Novel Approaches Research Division]]
- **Backstory:** 
	- Born to a respectable family in 1740, Rowyn showed exceptional intellectual gifts from an early age. Her fascination with medicine began when she witnessed a street surgeon operate on her injured cousin. Rather than being repulsed by the blood, she was transfixed by the surgeon's power over life and death. She pursued medical training in Edinburgh against social conventions for women, displaying remarkable aptitude and dedication. Rowyn's mother—her primary supporter and advocate—died in 1760, caught by a bullet in an incident related to the [[Seven Years War]]. Despite all her medical knowledge Rowyn could do nothing but watch as her life slipped away in agony. This traumatic experience left her both alone in the world and with a deep-seated frustration at medicine's limitations and her own perceived deficiencies. [[Gideon Aldrich]], hearing of her exceptional skills and unconventional thinking, recruited her specifically for the [[Monarchium]] program, seeing in her the necessary combination of brilliance, ambition, and lack of conventional restraint needed to advance their research.
- **Appearance:** 
	- Age: 21 (born 1740)
	- Gender: Female
	- Notable Features: Striking teal eyes that seem to absorb everything they observe, strikingly beautiful face, dark hair typically styled practically for medical work but also carrying a subtle elegance, youthful features, tall and slender build with graceful movements that belie her physical strength
	- Preferred Attire: Fashionable [[Georgian period attire]] modified with practical elements for her work—dresses adapted with form-fitting coat-like elements across shoulders and arms, allowing both professional appearance and freedom of movement; numerous hidden pockets containing surgical tools and research notes; preference for deeper colors that don't show blood stains easily, though later she adopts some lighter colors to subtly flaunt her profession morbidly through the quiet though public display of various blood stains.
- **Personality:** 
	- Primary Traits: Ambitious, exceptionally intelligent, emotionally detached, increasingly manipulative, obsessive about her research
	- Secondary Traits:
		- Observant: Notices minute details others miss
		- Methodical: Approaches problems with systematic precision
		- Adaptable: Quickly adjusts strategies to achieve her goals
		- Charismatic: Can be charming when it serves her purposes
		- Ruthlessly pragmatic: Views most people as means to an end
	- Psychological Elements:
		- Shows cluster B personality disorder traits that were present before age 18
		- Growing fascination with the threshold between pain and pleasure
		- Deeply analytical about human psychology and physiology
		- Views herself as transcending conventional morality in pursuit of knowledge
		- Haunted by memories of her mother's painful death
- **Goals**
	- Advance Monarchium research beyond its intended boundaries
	- Master the transformation of pain into more useful sensations
	- Gain recognition and authority within Ravenwood's hierarchy
	- Discover the limits of human transformation and transcendence
