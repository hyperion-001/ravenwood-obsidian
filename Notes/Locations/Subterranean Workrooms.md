# Subterranean Workrooms
*Hidden research chambers where controversial experiments unfold in carefully controlled isolation beneath layers of secrecy and stone*

## General

- **Type:** Secret Research Facility
- **Description:** Located on the first underground level of the Paracelsus Tower, the Subterranean Workrooms comprise a series of specialized laboratories designed for research requiring exceptional privacy, security, or containment. This level features a circular central corridor following the tower's perimeter, with eight wedge-shaped chambers radiating inward like pie sections, each dedicated to different research specialties or experimental approaches.

  Unlike the ornate spaces above ground, these workrooms embody utilitarian functionality with robust stone walls, reinforced doorways, and practical stone flooring with integrated drainage channels. Each chamber features specialized ventilation systems that can be independently controlled, allowing for containment of odors, smoke, or potentially harmful vapors. Illumination comes from a combination of clever light wells disguised as architectural features above ground and specialized oil lamps designed to provide optimal brightness for detailed work.

  The chambers vary in their specific configurations based on research focus, but all contain essential elements: stone workbenches with chemical-resistant surfaces, secure storage cabinets for equipment and materials, water supply through copper pipes, and waste disposal systems that bypass the estate's main drainage. Certain rooms feature additional specialized elements—cold storage areas maintained through ingenious ice delivery systems, enhanced ventilation for chemical work, reinforced restraint systems for unpredictable subjects, or soundproofing for experiments involving noise or distressed responses.

  Access to this level is tightly controlled through a single entrance from the tower above, concealed behind what appears to be a storage closet in the Entry Hall. A secondary access point connects directly to the Passage Nexus below, allowing for discreet movement of materials, specimens, or personnel without passing through public areas. Security measures include heavy doors with sophisticated locking mechanisms, regular patrols by trusted security staff, and a strict authorization protocol for both entry and specific chamber use.

  Despite the utilitarian design, the craftsmanship throughout remains exceptional, with precisely cut stonework, well-engineered systems, and carefully designed workspace layouts. The environment maintains a consistent cool temperature regardless of exterior conditions, with the thick stone walls providing natural insulation. The atmosphere carries a distinct blend of scents—stone dust, lamp oil, chemical agents, and the faint metallic hint of medical tools—creating an immediate sensory indication of transition into a different category of research space.
- **Within/Region:** [[Paracelsus Tower]], underground level, [[Ravenwood Estate]]
- **Contains:** 
	- Specialized Research Chambers - Eight wedge-shaped laboratories
	- Central Circular Corridor - Access passage to individual rooms
	- Secure Storage Facilities - Protected equipment and material storage
	- Specimen Preparation Area - Space for processing research subjects
	- Chemical Workroom - Chamber for pharmaceutical experiments
	- Anatomical Laboratory - Space for detailed dissection work
	- Containment Chamber - Reinforced room for unpredictable subjects

- **Affiliations:** [[Blackwood Family]], [[Ravenwood Medical Faculty]], [[Research Security Division]]
- **Significance:** The Subterranean Workrooms represent the critical intermediate layer of Ravenwood's research hierarchy—work too sensitive for the regular laboratories above ground but not requiring the extreme isolation of facilities beyond the estate. This level accommodates research that bridges conventional and experimental approaches, providing space for methodologies that push boundaries while maintaining a connection to established medical practice. The workrooms' position directly beneath the public face of the Paracelsus Tower symbolizes the institution's layered approach to knowledge—presenting acceptable research to the world while conducting more controversial work below the surface. The direct connection to the underground passage network further emphasizes this duality, allowing for movement of materials, specimens, and personnel without public knowledge.
