# Passage Nexus
*Subterranean hub where all hidden pathways converge beneath a magnificent rotunda of engineered precision*

## General

- **Type:** Underground Central Junction
- **Description:** Located directly beneath the Paracelsus Tower, the Passage Nexus serves as the central hub of Ravenwood's entire underground network. This impressive circular chamber measures approximately fifty feet in diameter with a domed ceiling rising twenty feet at its center. The space combines architectural elegance with practical functionality in a way that exemplifies the Blackwood approach to infrastructure.

  The chamber's design follows a wheel-like layout, with eight primary passages radiating outward at regular intervals, each wide enough for wheeled carts to pass and clearly marked with elegant bronze plaques indicating destinations and distances. Between these main corridors are narrower secondary passages and maintenance tunnels, creating a total of sixteen potential exit points arranged around the perimeter. The floor features concentric circles of alternating stone types, creating both aesthetic appeal and practical guidance—each ring corresponds to a different category of destination, helping users quickly navigate to the correct passage.

  At the chamber's center stands a remarkable mechanical lift system—a hexagonal platform surrounded by ornate ironwork that connects directly to Rowyn's Quarters at the tower's summit. This engineering marvel operates through a sophisticated counterweight system concealed within the tower's walls, allowing for silent and efficient vertical transport without requiring excessive physical effort. The platform is large enough to accommodate three people or a substantial amount of equipment and materials.

  The walls are lined with fine brickwork in a herringbone pattern, with regularly spaced niches containing oil lamps that provide consistent illumination. Several alcoves around the perimeter house specialized equipment: a small medical station for emergencies, a communication system connecting to key estate locations, a security checkpoint with supervision capabilities, and a materials transfer area for coordinating movements of sensitive items.

  The ceiling features an elaborate ventilation system disguised within decorative medallions, ensuring fresh air circulation despite the subterranean location. Drainage channels cleverly integrated into the floor design prevent any water accumulation, while the slightly raised central platform where the lift mechanism stands ensures critical systems remain dry even in unusual circumstances.
- **Within/Region:** [[Underground Passage Network]], beneath [[Paracelsus Tower]]
- **Contains:** 
	- Central Lift Mechanism - Direct connection to Rowyn's Quarters
	- Primary Passage Entrances - Eight major corridors to key locations
	- Secondary Tunnels - Eight additional connections to lesser destinations
	- Security Checkpoint - Monitoring and access control station
	- Emergency Medical Station - Basic treatment supplies and equipment
	- Communication Center - Connection to various estate locations

- **Affiliations:** [[Blackwood Family]], [[Ravenwood Security]], [[Estate Maintenance Division]]
- **Significance:** The Passage Nexus represents both the literal and symbolic center of Ravenwood's hidden operations, where all secret pathways converge and from which all clandestine activities are coordinated. Its position directly beneath the Paracelsus Tower rather than the main castle emphasizes the true power structure of the estate, prioritizing medical research over traditional authority. The nexus serves not only as a transportation hub but as a control center for monitoring movement throughout the underground network, ensuring security and efficiency in all hidden operations. Its sophisticated design and engineering showcase the Blackwood family's commitment to infrastructure that is both beautiful and functional, even when hidden from public view. The direct connection to Rowyn's Quarters via the lift mechanism creates a straight line of control from the highest private sanctum to the deepest secret infrastructure.
