# Shadow Realm Access Point
*Arcane threshold where worlds converge beneath the power of the dark moon*

## General

- **Type:** Magical Portal
- **Description:** Not a permanent physical location but rather a temporary manifestation that appears within the massive ritual circle on the floor of the Hall of Phases during the dark moon phase. When activated through specific ceremonies, the intricate silver, moonstone, and obsidian inlays in the floor begin to glow with a deep indigo light, gradually intensifying until the entire pattern seems to sink into the floor, creating a spiraling pathway downward that leads not into the physical space below but into the Shadow Realms. The portal appears as a swirling vortex of stars and darkness, surrounded by a border of silver light that maintains separation between realms. Cold air flows upward from the opening, carrying strange scents and sounds not found in the natural world. The surrounding room darkens significantly during activation, with only the enchanted orbs providing illumination. The portal remains stable only for the duration of the dark moon phase, requiring careful timing for exploration, and its specific terminus within the Shadow Realms depends on precise adjustments to the activation ritual.
- **Within/Region:** [[Hall of Phases]], [[Lunar Tower]], [[Lunar Sanctum]]
- **Contains:** 
	- Portal Manifestation - Temporary gateway to other realms
	- Ritual Circle - Physical framework that enables the portal
	- Shadow Pathway - Transitional space between realms
	- Gateway Wards - Protective boundaries maintaining separation
- **Affiliations:** [[Thorne Family]], [[Lunar Sanctum]], [[Shadow Realms]]
- **Significance:** The Shadow Realm Access Point represents one of the few stable, controlled gateways to these mysterious dimensions in England. Unlike spontaneous or unpredictable portals that occasionally form elsewhere, this access point follows consistent rules and patterns, making it invaluable for research and exploration. The gateway's position within the heavily protected Lunar Sanctum helps ensure that potentially dangerous entities cannot easily cross between realms, while its limitation to dark moon phases provides a natural safety mechanism preventing prolonged openings. The knowledge required to properly activate and control the portal has been carefully guarded by the Thorne family for generations, with each successive practitioner adding refinements to the technique.
