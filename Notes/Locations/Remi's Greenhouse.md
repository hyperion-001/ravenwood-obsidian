# Remi's Greenhouse 
*[tagline]*

## General

- **Type:** (City, Mountain, Forest, etc.) 

- **Description:**
	- Narrative description:
		- The greenhouse is a sanctuary of warmth and light, its glass panels filtering the morning sun into a soft, diffused glow. The air is thick with humidity and the mingled fragrances of countless herbs - sweet lavender, soothing chamomile, sharp mint, and earthy sage create an intoxicating aromatherapeutic atmosphere. Wooden drying racks line the walls, their beams weathered and worn smooth from years of use. Hundreds of herb bundles hang from them, creating a captivating display of greens, purples, and whites. The gentle morning breeze sneaking through the slightly open door causes the dried herbs to dance and sway, releasing subtle waves of their combined fragrances. The workbench is solid oak, its surface marked with years of loving use - small stains from spilled oils, slight indentations from countless hours of herb preparation. Glass jars of varying sizes catch the light, their contents a rainbow of dried petals, leaves, and stems, each meticulously labeled in Remi's careful handwriting. In one corner, a small pot of water simmers gently over a carefully controlled flame, ready for tea preparation. The steam rises in lazy spirals, catching the filtered sunlight. Small baskets filled with fresh herbs wait to be processed, their dewdrops still glistening in the morning light. The greenhouse feels intimate and peaceful, a private world where the outside concerns seem to fade away, replaced by the gentle rhythm of nature and healing.
