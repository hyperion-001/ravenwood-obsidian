# The Local Environment of Harbottle, Northumberland in the 18th Century (Before 1765)

Harbottle is a small village nestled in the upper Coquet Valley in central Northumberland, England. Located within the Northumberland National Park, it boasts a rich history and a landscape shaped by both natural forces and human endeavors. This report delves into the local environment around Harbottle in the 18th century, specifically before 1765, utilizing historical documents, maps, and accounts of the period.

## Geography and Topography

Harbottle is situated in the upper Coquet Valley, approximately 8km northwest of Rothbury 1. The village is located on the road that follows the River Coquet, linking it to other small upland villages like Barrowburn and Alwinton 1. The River Coquet meanders through the valley, curving north of Harbottle Castle before flowing eastwards 1. The village itself is nestled to the south and southeast of the castle ruins, possibly in what was once a channel of the river 1.

The surrounding landscape is characterized by steep slopes descending to the river on three sides, providing natural defenses and commanding views up and down the valley 1. Imagine standing on a hillside, the ground falling away sharply beneath you, with the River Coquet winding through the valley below. From this vantage point, you could survey the surrounding area, with the imposing ruins of Harbottle Castle dominating the landscape. The castle, strategically positioned on a central ridge, overlooks the valley floor, providing extensive views and control over the surrounding area 1.

Even in the 14th century, Harbottle Castle was a prominent feature in the landscape. Historical maps from this period, such as the Gough Map (c. 1350-60), depict the castle as a pair of towers with an attached building, highlighting its significance even then 1.

Northumberland in general has a diverse geography, ranging from the agricultural eastern coastal plain to the rugged hills and moors of the west 2. The Cheviot Hills, forming the Scottish border, and the Pennines to the west, contribute to the county's varied topography 2. Harbottle, located in the central uplands, is part of this diverse landscape, with its own unique character defined by the River Coquet and the surrounding hills.

## Climate

The climate of Northumberland in the 18th century was generally cool and wet, with rainfall varying from 25 inches on the coast to 50 inches in the Cheviot Hills 2. While specific climate data for Harbottle in this period is limited, broader regional trends suggest a period of climatic instability. The 18th century fell within the "Little Ice Age," a period of cooler temperatures across Europe 3. This period saw colder and wetter conditions, which likely impacted agriculture and daily life in Harbottle. The cooler climate may have shortened growing seasons and limited the types of crops that could be cultivated. This, in turn, could have influenced the local diet and the overall economy of the village.

Historical weather records from London indicate that the summers between 1751 and 1760 were particularly wet, with an overall anomaly of 127% of the modern-era mean 4. This suggests that Harbottle may have experienced a series of wet summers in the years leading up to 1765. These wet summers could have posed challenges to farmers, potentially leading to crop failures and difficulties in raising livestock.

The impact of climate change on arable farming was also significant. The colder and wetter conditions that characterized the "Little Ice Age" led to a contraction of arable land, as the upper limits of cultivation fell 3. This further emphasizes the challenges faced by communities like Harbottle in maintaining agricultural productivity in a changing climate.

## Natural Resources

While specific details about the natural resources around Harbottle in the 18th century are scarce, the area was likely dominated by resources typical of rural Northumberland. The presence of the River Coquet suggests a source of freshwater and potentially fish. The surrounding uplands likely provided grazing land for livestock and potentially timber resources.

One notable natural feature near Harbottle is the Drake Stone, a massive sandstone boulder with alleged healing powers 5. This stone, originally called the Dragon stone or Draak's stone, is believed to have been deposited by a glacier during the last Ice Age and may have held cultural significance for the local community.

The geology of Northumberland includes a variety of rocks, including sandstone, limestone, and coal-bearing rocks 2. Many of the buildings in Harbottle are constructed from a pale, biscuit-colored sandstone, reflecting the local geology 5. While coal mining became a significant industry in Northumberland later in the 18th century, it is unclear to what extent it was exploited in the Harbottle area before 1765.

## Agriculture

Agriculture in 18th century Northumberland was undergoing a period of transformation, with the agricultural revolution bringing new crops, livestock breeds, and farming methods 6. While specific details about agriculture in Harbottle are limited, the broader trends in the region provide some insights.

Upland regions like Redesdale, where Harbottle is located, typically relied on a pastoral economy, with a focus on sheep and cattle 7. The challenging terrain and climate limited arable farming, and the practice of transhumance, moving livestock between valley meadows in winter and hillside pastures in summer, was common 7. This reliance on pastoralism is likely linked to the challenging climate of the region, as discussed earlier. The cooler temperatures and shorter growing seasons may have made it more difficult to cultivate crops, favoring the raising of livestock that could graze on the uplands.

The agricultural revolution brought changes to land ownership and farming practices. Enclosure of common land, while facing resistance, allowed for improved husbandry and the introduction of new crop rotations 6. The use of sown grasses, clovers, and turnips increased yields and provided winter feed for livestock 6. This increased productivity may have contributed to the growth of the village and improved living standards.

Another aspect of agriculture in Northumberland during this time was the "infield and outfield" system 7. In this system, the infield was intensively cultivated, while the outfield was used for rough pasture. When part of the infield became exhausted, an area of the outfield was temporarily brought under cultivation, and the exhausted area was allowed to lie fallow to recover its fertility. This system highlights the adaptability of farmers in managing land resources in a sustainable way.

The Reformation and the Dissolution of the Monasteries in the 16th century also had a significant impact on land ownership and agriculture 7. These events led to changes in land tenure and allowed a growing class of merchants and industrialists to enter the land market. This may have led to changes in land use and agricultural practices in the Harbottle area.

Estates played a crucial role in agricultural improvements during this period 8. They were involved in restructuring agriculture, relocating farmsteads, and developing new crop rotations. This suggests a degree of centralized planning and investment in improving agricultural productivity.

The types of farmsteads present in the area varied, with courtyard-plan farmsteads dominating the south and east, while linear and dispersed-plan farmsteads were more common closer to the moorland 8. This diversity reflects the varied landscape and the different agricultural practices employed in the region.

Technological advancements also played a role in agricultural development. Threshing machines, invented in the late 18th century, were becoming increasingly common in Northumberland 6. These machines, driven by horses, water, or wind power, helped to increase efficiency in separating grain from straw and chaff.

## Industries

Information about specific industries in Harbottle before 1765 is limited. However, the broader context of Northumberland's industrial development provides some clues.

In the 18th century, Northumberland was transitioning towards a mineral-based energy economy, with coal mining playing a crucial role 9. While large-scale coal mining developed later in the century, it is possible that smaller-scale coal extraction occurred in the Harbottle area.

Other industries in Northumberland during this period included iron-working, shipbuilding, and weaving 9. The presence of the River Coquet may have supported small-scale industries like grain milling, similar to other towns in the region 10.

## Harbottle Castle

Harbottle Castle, now in ruins, was once a significant stronghold and a center for local administration 11. Built in the 12th century, it played a crucial role in defending the border with Scotland and maintaining law and order in the region. The castle's presence likely influenced the social structure and daily life of the village, providing employment, protection, and a focal point for the community.

## Social and Cultural Life

Details about the social and cultural life in Harbottle before 1765 are scarce. However, the village's location in a remote upland region suggests a close-knit community with a strong connection to the land. The presence of Harbottle Castle, once a significant stronghold, likely influenced the social structure and daily life of the village.

The broader context of Northumberland's history suggests a society shaped by its border location and a history of conflict with Scotland. The reivers of Redesdale, notorious border raiders, were active in the region until the 17th century 5.

### The Reivers of Redesdale

The reivers were families who lived in the borderlands between England and Scotland. They were known for their cattle raiding and other acts of lawlessness. The reivers were a significant presence in Redesdale, and their activities would have impacted the social and economic life of the region. By the 18th century, however, law and order were more established, and daily life likely revolved around agriculture and local traditions.

The social structure of Votadini farms, the ancestors of the people who lived in the area, provides a historical perspective on social organization in the area 12. These farms were often surrounded by walls, banks, and ditches, suggesting a need for defense and a hierarchical social structure.

Religious life also played a role in the community. The Brethren, a religious group, were present in the area, and hymn singing was an important part of their worship 13. This highlights the diversity of cultural and religious practices in 18th-century Northumberland.
