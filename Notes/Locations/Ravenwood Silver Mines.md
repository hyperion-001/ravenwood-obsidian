# Ravenwood Silver Mines 
*Ancient tunnels where silver and cobalt were extracted, now abandoned.*

## General

- **Type:** Mining complex, abandoned 
- **Description:** An extensive network of tunnels and shafts carved into the northern hills beyond Ravenwood's crescent lake, approximately one mile from the castle. The mines feature multiple entrances, with the primary opening situated directly beneath the Chrysalis Stone. The tunnels extend several levels deep, with the lowest passages now flooded. Upper tunnels reveal dramatic blue-silver veins of Ravenwood cobalt interspersed with traditional silver ore. Abandoned mining equipment, partially collapsed tunnels, and the occasional curious blue mineral formation create an atmosphere of decayed industry touched by something otherworldly.
- **Region:** [[Northern Hills of Northmire]], [[Northumberland]] 
- **Culture:** Mining traditions, local superstitions, folklore practices 
- **Affiliations:** 
	- [[Blackwood Family]]
	- [[Ravenwood Estate]]
	- [[Harbottle Mining Guild]] (historical)
- **Significance:** The mines were the original source of the Blackwood family's wealth and the foundation upon which Ravenwood was built. They provided the unique Ravenwood cobalt that has become a symbol of the estate and may be connected to the development of Monarchium. Though officially closed since 1723, the mines remain a powerful presence in local folklore and potentially hold secrets relevant to ongoing research.
- **Sub-Locations**
	- [[North Shaft]] - The deepest mining area, now partially flooded
	- [[East Mining Tunnels]] - Where the highest concentration of Ravenwood cobalt was found
	- [[Underground Crossroads]] - Major junction 300 feet below the surface where multiple tunnels converge
	- [[Silver Mine Chapel]] - Small underground shrine where miners would pray before shifts
	- [[Chamber of the Presence]] - Mysterious chamber discovered just before closure, allegedly sealed by direct order of the Duke

## Meta Integration

- **Characters:**
	- [[Malcolm Blackwood]] - Current owner, maintains sealed records of the final mining operations
	- [[Gideon Aldrich]] - Has reportedly taken samples from specific tunnels for research
	- [[Margaret Blackwood]] - Restricts access to certain mine entrances, claiming concern for safety
	- [[Thomas Carpenter]] - Former mine foreman, now elderly but full of stories about the "knockers" and other mine spirits

- **Items:**
	- [[Chrysalis Stone]] - Sits directly above the main entrance
	- [[Ravenwood Cobalt]] - The distinctive blue-silver metal extracted from the mines
	- [[Miners' Talismans]] - Small cobalt-infused tokens carried for protection

	- [[Mine Foreman's Records]] - Detailed logs including unusual incidents

- **Locations:** 
	- [[Underground Lake]] - Flooded lower level with reported unusual properties
	- [[Foreman's Office]] - Small stone building at the main entrance, now used for storage
	- [[Resonarium]] - Cavern where the richest cobalt veins were found, named for the high-pitched sound they reportedly emit
	- [[Extraction Works]] - Where ore was initially processed, now in ruins
	- [[Miners' Settlement]] - Abandoned cluster of stone cottages where workers once lived

- **Lore & Timelines**
	- [[Discovery of Silver 1270]] - Initial mining operations begin
	- [[First Cobalt Extraction 1312]] - When the unique blue-silver veins were first discovered
	- [[The Great Collapse of 1601]] - Major cave-in that claimed 12 lives and revealed new veins
	- [[Discovery of Chamber of the Presence 1720]] - Finding of mysterious chamber shortly before closure
	- [[Unsealing Expedition 1745]] - Malcolm Blackwood's father briefly reopened certain sections
	- [[The Singing Veins]] - Legend of cobalt veins that emit sounds only certain people can hear
	- [[The Midnight Glow]] - Reports of blue light emanating from mine entrances on clear nights
	
	- **Historical Operations**
		1. **Silver Phase (1270-1312)**: [[Discovery of Silver 1270]], Initial discovery and extraction focused solely on silver deposits
		2. **First Cobalt Boom (1312-1450)**: After discovery of the unique blue-silver veins and their properties
		3. **Expansion Era (1450-1601)**: Period of maximum operations with over 300 miners
		4. **Recovery Period (1602-1650)**: Rebuilding after the Great Collapse, smaller scale operations
		5. **Decline Years (1650-1720)**: Gradually diminishing returns as accessible veins were depleted
		6. **Final Explorations (1720-1723)**: Focus on exploring deeper rather than extraction, ended with mysterious incidents and official closure. 
			1. [[Closure Order 1723]]
			2. [[Drowning of 1722]]
	
	- **Mining Folklore**
		1. **[[Knockers]]**: Mine spirits believed to tap on walls before cave-ins. Miners who left small offerings of food would hear warning knocks, while those who didn't often met with accidents.
		2. **[[Blue Blood Curse]]**: Miners who worked too long with Ravenwood cobalt developed blue-tinged fingernails and palms that could not be washed away. These "blue-blooded" miners could allegedly sense storms coming and feel the presence of water underground
		3. **[[Resonarium]]**: Deep within the mines, the richest cobalt-silver veins were said to emit a faint, high-pitched ringing sound that only certain people could hear. Those who could were considered "chosen by the stone."
		4. **[[Witch Glow]]**: Locals claim that on particularly clear nights, the abandoned mine entrances emit a faint blue glow, visible only from certain angles.
		5. **[[Drowning of 1722]]**: The official reason for closure was flooding, but local stories suggest something was disturbed in the deepest tunnels that called the water to it.
