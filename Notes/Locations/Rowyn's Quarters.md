# Rowyn's Quarters
*Regal sanctuary of medical innovation where a brilliant surgical apprentice pursues ambitious research beneath a dome that bears witness to her growing darkness*

## General

- **Type:** Private Residence and Laboratory
- **Description:** Occupying the entire eighth floor of the Paracelsus Tower, Rowyn's Quarters combine sophisticated living space with advanced research facilities. The circular layout divides naturally into three main sections: the northern half devoted to an expansive private laboratory, the southeastern quadrant housing elegant living quarters, and the southwestern portion containing a private study and reception area. The entire space is accessed via both the main spiral staircase and a private lift mechanism disguised within an ornate wooden cabinet, engineered to connect directly with the underground passage system.

  The northern half of the floor features floor-to-ceiling windows offering commanding views across the entire Ravenwood Estate. From this vantage point, one can observe all major sectors of the grounds, from the Castle Proper to the distant tree line, making it an ideal location for overseeing estate operations. The windows incorporate subtle optical enhancements that allow for detailed observation of distant activities when desired. The laboratory portion contains equipment of both traditional and experimental design, much of it adapted to Rowyn's specifications. Multiple workstations accommodate different research pursuits, from alchemical distillation to anatomical studies to pharmaceutical development, with a special focus on pain management and transformation.

  The living quarters exude calculated sophistication, featuring a private bedchamber with a canopied bed, a dressing room with extensive wardrobes specially modified to accommodate her practical adaptations to period attire, and a luxurious bathing chamber equipped with advanced plumbing systems rare for the era. The décor balances feminine refinement with scholarly gravitas—silk damask in deep jewel tones that wouldn't show bloodstains adorns the walls, while bookshelves lined with leather-bound volumes create an atmosphere of intellectual pursuit. Personal touches include carefully arranged surgical tools displayed as art pieces and discreetly placed mementos from her Edinburgh training and her late mother.

  The study and reception area serves for both private contemplation and select meetings too sensitive for public spaces. A large desk positioned to catch optimal lighting from the western windows allows for administrative work and correspondence, while comfortable seating arranged around a small fireplace accommodates intimate gatherings, particularly with her mentor Gideon Aldrich. Hidden panels in the wood paneling conceal both storage for sensitive documents and additional security measures, including observation devices monitoring key areas of the tower below.

  Throughout the quarters, the lighting has been meticulously designed to serve both practical and aesthetic purposes, with adjustable candle sconces, oil lamps with specialized reflectors, and strategic skylights in the copper dome above. The entire space maintains a comfortable temperature year-round through an innovative system of heating flues and ventilation channels integrated into the walls, allowing for precise climate control regardless of exterior conditions.

- **Significance:** Rowyn's Quarters represent both the physical manifestation of her rapid rise within Ravenwood's research hierarchy and a carefully crafted environment for her increasingly ambitious studies. As both a private sanctuary and an advanced research space, the quarters embody the dual nature of Rowyn's position—a brilliant young surgical apprentice publicly pursuing medical innovation while privately pushing far beyond conventional boundaries. The strategic placement at the tower's summit, with its comprehensive view of the estate, reinforces her growing oversight role while providing necessary privacy for sensitive work. The quarters serve not only as living space but as a command center for her expanding research initiatives, particularly those requiring discretion. The direct connection to the underground passage network allows Rowyn to move between key locations without public observation, maintaining the separation between her official activities and more controversial pursuits.
