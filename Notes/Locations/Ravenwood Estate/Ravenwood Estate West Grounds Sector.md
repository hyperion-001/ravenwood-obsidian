# West Grounds Sector
*The expansive outdoor domain where formal gardens transition to functional lands and wilderness*

## General

- **Type:** Estate grounds and working lands
- **Description:** A substantial area of landscaped and functional grounds extending from the southwestern edge of the castle. The sector features a gradual transition from formal gardens near the castle to more utilitarian spaces and eventually wilder areas approaching the forest. The centerpiece is a distinctive cross-shaped chapel surrounded by cemetery grounds, memorial gardens, and a small orchard. Throughout the sector, carefully designed landscape elements—stone walls, walking paths, small ponds, and strategic plantings—create a sense of deliberate design even in seemingly natural areas. Various structures dot the landscape, including groundskeeper cottages, garden sheds, small agricultural outbuildings, and decorative follies. The sector serves both aesthetic and practical purposes, providing beauty, food production, and a buffer zone between the castle and surrounding wilderness.

- **Region:** [[Ravenwood Estate]], [[Northmire]]
- **Culture:** Blend of formal garden tradition, agricultural function, and estate maintenance
- **Affiliations:** [[Blackwood Family]]
- **Significance:** The SW Grounds embody the practical aspects of estate life that support Ravenwood's more academic pursuits. This sector provides essential resources through kitchen gardens and orchards, recreational spaces for castle residents, and the spiritual center of estate life in the chapel and cemetery. The grounds also serve as a buffer zone between the structured order of castle life and the wilder natural world beyond, physically representing the balance between civilization and nature, order and chaos.
