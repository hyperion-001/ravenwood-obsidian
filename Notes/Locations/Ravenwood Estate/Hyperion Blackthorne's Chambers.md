# Hyperion's Chambers
*[[Hyperion Blackthorne]]'s private chambers in the [[North Shadow Tower]].*

## General

- **Type:** Private quarters/occult workshop within Ravenwood Castle
- **Description:** Occupying the entirety of the East Tower's uppermost floor, Hyperion's chambers form a complex suite of interconnected spaces that serve as both living quarters and supernatural workshop. 
	- The circular *main chamber* spans the full diameter of the tower, with four smaller rooms radiating from it like cardinal points. Tall arched windows line the outer walls, though many are covered with specially treated crimson drapes that filter sunlight to a blood-red glow. The centerpiece of the main chamber is a circular mosaic floor depicting angelic script arranged in concentric rings, which subtly shifts its patterns to mirror the living text on Hyperion's skin when he's in residence. The walls are lined with specially constructed bookshelves containing texts too dangerous for even the restricted section of the Library of Shadows. 
	- The *northern alcove* contains his sleeping quarters, featuring a large four-poster bed with protective symbols carved into its frame.
	- The *eastern alcove* houses his personal collection of corrupted religious artifacts. 
	- The *southern alcove* serves as a traditional study with a large desk made from pale ash wood that somehow refuses to hold ink permanently. 
	- The *western alcove* contains ritual space with a raised dais and various specialized tools for working with divine energy. 
	- Most striking to visitors is how the very architecture seems aliveâ€”the stone walls occasionally ripple with faint script that mimics Hyperion's markings, and the ambient temperature fluctuates based on the supernatural activities recently conducted within.
    
- **Within:** [[Ravenwood Estate]] > [[Ravenwood Estate Library of Shadows Sector]] >[[North Shadow Tower]]
- **Culture:** Blend of academic rigor and occult practice, with elements drawn from various mystical traditions
- **Affiliations:** Officially part of the [[Ravenwood Estate Library of Shadows Sector]], though functionally autonomous due to special arrangement with [[Malcolm Blackwood]], overall [[Ravenwood Estate]]. Significant affiliation with [[Lilith Ravenna Blackwood]].
- **Significance:** One of the few spaces at Ravenwood specifically designed to contain and channel supernatural energies. The chambers act as both sanctuary and laboratory for Hyperion's unique abilities, with architectural and mystical modifications that respond to his divine corruption. The location also serves as an unofficial meeting point between the scientific and supernatural aspects of Ravenwood's research.
