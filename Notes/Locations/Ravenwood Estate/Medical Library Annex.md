# Medical Library Annex
*Specialized knowledge repository where carefully curated texts support the tower's research while bridging tradition and innovation*

## General

- **Type:** Specialized Library
- **Description:** Occupying the entire first floor of the Paracelsus Tower, the Medical Library Annex serves as a focused extension of the main Library of Shadows, housing collections specifically relevant to the tower's research and educational activities. The circular space maintains the tower's elegant aesthetic while optimizing functionality for scholarly use, creating an environment that balances accessibility with proper respect for valuable knowledge.

  The room's layout follows a wheel-and-spoke design, with eight tall bookcases radiating from a central reading area like spokes, creating pie-shaped sections dedicated to different medical specialties. Additional shelving lines the perimeter walls, with specially designed cabinetry for oversized volumes, delicate manuscripts, and anatomical folios. Large windows between these perimeter shelves provide abundant natural light, supplemented by carefully positioned oil lamps for cloudy days and evening study. Window seats beneath each opening offer comfortable reading spaces with excellent illumination.

  At the center stands a large circular reading table crafted from polished oak with inlaid designs representing medical and alchemical symbols. This communal workspace accommodates up to sixteen readers simultaneously, with additional smaller tables positioned near the perimeter for more private study. Comfortable chairs with padded leather seats support extended research sessions, while specialized book stands protect valuable volumes during consultation.

  The collection focuses on practical medical knowledge, anatomical studies, surgical techniques, pharmaceutical preparations, and the theoretical foundations that unite these disciplines. While avoiding the more controversial or potentially dangerous texts kept in the main library's restricted sections, the annex nevertheless contains advanced materials requiring sophisticated understanding. Several glass-fronted cabinets house rare volumes available only with special permission, including first editions of Paracelsus's own works and important historical medical treatises.

  Unlike the main library's imposing atmosphere, the annex cultivates a more accessible environment designed to encourage regular use by students and researchers at various levels. The space maintains a pleasant temperature year-round through an innovative heating system beneath the floor, while the air carries the comforting scent of leather bindings, quality paper, and beeswax polish. Subtle acoustic properties allow for quiet conversation without disturbing others, creating a scholarly atmosphere that balances concentration with occasional consultation.

- **Significance:** The Medical Library Annex functions as both a practical resource center and a symbolic bridge between Ravenwood's general knowledge repository and its specialized medical research. By housing a carefully curated collection focused on the tower's specific needs, the annex creates efficient access to relevant materials while maintaining appropriate separation between general medical knowledge and more sensitive research. Its position on the first floor—above the public entry hall but below the active research spaces—reflects its intermediate status in the knowledge hierarchy, providing a foundation for the work conducted in higher levels. The annex also serves a social function, creating a neutral space where individuals from different specialties and ranks regularly interact through their shared use of resources.
