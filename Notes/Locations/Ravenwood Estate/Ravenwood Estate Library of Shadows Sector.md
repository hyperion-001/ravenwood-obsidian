# Library of Shadows Sector
*Ancient repository of knowledge where mundane and mysterious texts coexist in a labyrinth of learning*

## General

- **Type:** Grand library complex
- **Description:** A sprawling section in the southeastern portion of Ravenwood Castle, composed of multiple interconnected chambers housing one of the most comprehensive private collections in England. The architecture blends functional design with Gothic elements, featuring soaring bookshelves, spiral staircases, hidden alcoves, and reading rooms bathed in carefully controlled natural light. The main chamber rises through multiple levels with ornate galleries and catwalks connecting various sections. Beyond the public areas lie restricted archives, special collections requiring permission to access, and rumors of secret repositories hidden within the very walls. The atmosphere shifts noticeably as one moves deeper into the complex—from the bright, open public reading rooms to the hushed, shadow-filled special collections areas where rare and potentially dangerous knowledge is stored.

- **Region:** [[Ravenwood Estate]], [[Northmire]]
- **Culture:** Scholarly pursuit, knowledge preservation, hierarchical access
- **Affiliations:** [[Royal Society]] (limited), [[European Academic Institutions]], [[Private Collectors' Network]]
- **Significance:** The Library represents Ravenwood's intellectual heart and contains not only conventional academic works but also rare, controversial, and potentially dangerous knowledge carefully preserved and protected. Under Lilith Blackwood's stewardship, the library maintains a delicate balance—serving as a research resource for castle residents while carefully controlling access to its more sensitive collections. The library's unique organization system allows for both conventional academic study and the preservation of knowledge that might be destroyed elsewhere.
