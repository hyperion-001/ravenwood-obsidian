# Ravenwood Estate 
*An isolated domain of knowledge and secrets nestled in the hills of [[Northumberland]], where science, alchemy, and the supernatural blend within ancient lands*

## General

- **Type:** Country estate and surrounding lands 
- **Description:** A sprawling domain encompassing a Gothic-Renaissance castle, surrounding grounds, distinctive crescent-shaped lake, ancient silver mines, and acres of forested hills. The estate is centered around Ravenwood Castle proper, an imposing structure featuring distinctive white stone and intricate towers. The castle itself is organized into several interconnected sectors (Castle Proper, Medical/Research, Library of Shadows, Academic, Central Courtyard) with supporting areas (SW Grounds, surrounding countryside). The estate's defining physical features include the dramatic white cliffs overlooking Ravenwood Lake to the west, the forested northern hills containing the silver mines, and the carefully landscaped grounds surrounding the central structures. Ravenwood benefits from natural isolation, positioned in a valley surrounded by hills with limited approach routes, making it both defensible and private.
- **Region:** [[Northmire]], [[Northumberland]], Northern England 
- **Culture:** Blend of aristocratic tradition, academic pursuit, scientific innovation, and local folklore
- **Affiliations:** [[Blackwood Family]]
- **Significance:** Ravenwood Estate represents the seat of Blackwood power since 1267, evolving from a defensive border holding to its current incarnation as a center for medical and scientific advancement. The unique natural resources of the estate (particularly Ravenwood cobalt from the silver mines) provided the wealth that enabled the family's rise to prominence, while the isolated location has allowed increasingly private research endeavors. Under Duke Malcolm's stewardship, the estate has become a unique institution where extraordinary medical advancements occur far from prying eyes, including the revolutionary [[Monarchium]] research.
