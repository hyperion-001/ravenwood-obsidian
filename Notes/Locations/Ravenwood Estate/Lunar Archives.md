# Lunar Archives
*Ancient repository where generations of lunar magical knowledge rest behind formidable protective wards*

## General

- **Type:** Magical Library and Archive
- **Description:** The second level of the [[Lunar Sanctum]], accessible via the ornate spiral staircase from the [[Hall of Phases]]. This circular chamber is lined with curved bookshelves crafted from pale wood with silver inlays that form protective sigils. The ceiling features a dome painted with an accurate astronomical map that subtly shifts to reflect the current night sky. The center of the room houses a large circular table of polished silver-veined marble, surrounded by comfortable reading chairs. Carefully sealed cabinets along the walls contain more dangerous artifacts, including the notorious carnivorous mirror. The entire chamber is heavily warded with multiple layers of protective magic that respond to unauthorized visitors with increasing levels of deterrence. Small enchanted crystal lamps provide adjustable illumination, and the air carries the distinctive scent of old parchment, silver polish, and subtle magical preservatives.
- **Within/Region:** [[Lunar Tower]], [[Lunar Sanctum]], [[Ravenwood Estate]]
- **Contains:** 
	- Thorne Family Grimoires - Generations of magical knowledge bound in protective covers
	- Artifact Cabinets - Sealed storage for dangerous magical items
	- Astronomical Dome - Enchanted ceiling painting that tracks celestial movements
	- Research Table - Central workspace with embedded scrying surface
	- Ancient Lunar Texts - Historical magical documents from various traditions

- **Significance:** The Lunar Archives represents one of the most comprehensive collections of lunar magical knowledge in England, containing texts and artifacts gathered by the Thorne family over centuries. Unlike the more general collection in the Library of Shadows, these archives focus specifically on lunar and celestial magic, with particular emphasis on practical applications. The archives serve as both a historical repository and an active research resource, with many texts containing magical knowledge not found elsewhere. The protective measures surrounding the archives are multilayered and sophisticated, indicating the value and potential danger of its contents.
