# Ravenwood Lake 
*A crescent-shaped body of water that cradles Ravenwood Castle, concealing depths both literal and metaphorical*

## General

- **Type:** Lake
- **Description:** Roughly crescent-shaped body of water immediately west of Ravenwood estate. Fed by the Coquet River, it serves as point of access to the castle, a natural barrier, and a primary water source. The eastern part of the lake forms cliffs at the top of which stand the estate. Built into the cliffs, caves have been carved out to provide docks under the castle and access points to the water. Val's chambers are near the lake, opening out from the cliff face multiple stories up from the lake's surface across the expanse of water. The lake's unusual depth and exceptionally clear waters create a striking blue-black appearance that shifts with the light and weather. Local legends claim the water occasionally glows with a faint blue luminescence on moonless nights, particularly near the submerged cave systems.

- **Region:** [[Northmire]], [[Northumberland]]
- **Culture:** Local fishing traditions, water-based folklore, boating customs
- **Affiliations:** [[Blackwood Family]], [[Ravenwood Estate]]
- **Significance:** Beyond its practical value as a water source and transportation route, the lake creates a natural protective barrier for Ravenwood Castle. Its unusually deep central channel (over 200 feet in some places) connects to flooded cave systems that allegedly reach the lowest levels of the silver mines. The lake water contains trace elements of Ravenwood cobalt, giving it subtle properties that may contribute to both local healing traditions and scientific research at the castle.

## Additional

- **Narrative Integration**
	- Provides a natural connection to Val Blackfin's marine nature
	- Creates a semi-private route to and from Ravenwood for secret activities
	- Connects the castle physically to the mines through flooded passages
	- Offers atmospheric settings for key scenes (midnight boat journeys, shoreline conversations)
	- Lake water properties may connect to Monarchium research
	- Serves as a physical representation of the "depths" theme in the narrative

- **Physical Characteristics**
	- Approximate size: One mile long along curved axis, width varying from 150-300 yards
	- Depth ranges dramatically: 10-30 feet near shores, central channel 100-200+ feet
	- Water temperature: Surface warms seasonally, depths remain cold year-round
	- Water clarity: Exceptional visibility to 30+ feet in most areas
	- Color: Deep blue-black in center, lighter blue near shores, with occasional blue luminescence
	- Surrounding terrain: Cliffs along eastern shore (30-80 feet high), gentler slopes on western shore

- **Weather Patterns**
	- Frequent morning mist, particularly in spring and autumn
	- Wind patterns create distinctive wave formations unique to the crescent shape
	- Lake surface often remains peculiarly still during storms
	- Water level fluctuates more dramatically than expected with rainfall

	- Cooling system for certain castle operations via water channels

- **Unique Properties**
	- Water containing trace minerals from submerged cobalt veins
	- Unusual acoustic properties (sounds carry differently across water)
	- Small items made of Ravenwood cobalt float rather than sink
	- Certain areas maintain constant temperature regardless of season
	- Plants watered exclusively with lake water show accelerated growth
