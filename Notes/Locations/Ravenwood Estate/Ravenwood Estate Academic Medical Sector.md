# Academic Medical Sector
*Heart of Ravenwood's scientific innovation where medical advancement pushes the boundaries of possibility.*

## General

- **Type:** Specialized academic, medical, research buildings
- **Description:** A large area south of the [[Ravenwood Estate Central Courtyard Sector|Central Courtyard]], featuring a blend of academic buildings, medical facilities and research laboratories. The architecture is slightly more modern than [[Ravenwood Estate Castle Proper Sector|Castle Proper]], with large windows designed to maximize natural light and advanced ventilation systems to manage fumes and surgical vapors. The sector is organized around several key spaces: [[Paracelsus Tower]] housing living and workspaces, [[Main Surgical Theatre]] with observation gallery, [[Research Laboratories]], and [[Patient Wards]] for patients. The design emphasizes both functionality and concealment, with glass-windowed public areas allowing demonstration of conventional procedures while more sensitive research takes place in private chambers with restricted access. The entire sector exhibits meticulous attention to cleanliness, with white stone surfaces, tile floors that can be washed clean, and copper fixtures with antimicrobial properties.

- **Region:** [[Ravenwood Estate]], [[Northmire]]
- **Culture:** Scientific inquiry, medical innovation, professional hierarchy
- **Affiliations:** [[Ravenwood Estate]], [[Company of Surgeons]], [[Crown Military Medical Division]], [[Royal Society]] (loosely)
- **Significance:** The Academic Medical Sector represents the primary purpose of modern Ravenwood as established by the Royal Charter of 1756. Here, revolutionary medical advances are developed, including [[Monarchium]]. The sector serves both as a teaching facility for medical students and as a research center pushing the boundaries of medical science, with its isolation allowing exploration of techniques and treatments that might face scrutiny in more conventional institutions.
