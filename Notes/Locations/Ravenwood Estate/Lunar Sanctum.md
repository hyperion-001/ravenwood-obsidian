# Lunar Sanctum 
*Mystical tower where lunar magic and celestial secrets converge under the watchful eye of ancient enchantments*

## General

- **Type:** Tower and Garden Complex
- **Description:** A self-contained mystical structure nestled in the eastern part of the [[Ravenwood Estate Library of Shadows Sector|Library of Shadows]] just east of the Library itself, comprised of four floors and the enchanted Moon Garden with Willow Alcove on the ground floor. The entire sanctuary glows with a subtle silver light during nighttime hours, with enchanted crystal windows that capture and amplify moonlight. Each level of the tower serves a distinct purpose in lunar magic practice, from the historically significant [[Hall of Phases]] on the ground level to [[Luna's Quarters|Luna's Private Chambers]] at the pinnacle. The complex functions both as a living space and a working magical facility, with sophisticated ward systems protecting its secrets.
- **Within/Region:** [[Ravenwood Estate]], [[Ravenwood Estate Library of Shadows Sector]]
- **Contains:** 
	- [[Moon Garden]] - Mystical garden with crescent fountain and magical plantings
	- [[Hall of Phases]] - Ground floor of tower with lunar ritual circle
	- [[Lunar Archives]] - Second level housing ancient texts and artifacts
	- [[Practical Studies Chamber]] - Third level workspace for magical practice
	- [[Luna's Quarters]] - Top level private chambers
	- [[Observation Chamber]] - Hidden location accessible only during certain lunar phases
	- [[Shadow Realm Access Point]] - Activated during dark moon phases
- **Affiliations:** [[Thorne Family]], [[European Occult Network]], [[Ravenwood Estate Library of Shadows Sector]]
- **Significance:** The Lunar Sanctum represents one of the most significant concentrations of lunar magical knowledge in England. Built by [[Luna Thorne|Luna]]'s ancestors in 1482 atop much older foundations, it serves as both Luna's residence and the center of her occult studies. The sanctum's unique architecture channels and amplifies lunar energy, making it an ideal location for complex magical workings. The connection to the Shadow Realms through the floor of the Hall of Phases represents a rare stable access point to these mysterious dimensions.
