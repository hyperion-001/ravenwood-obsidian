# Luna's Quarters
*Enchanted sanctuary where celestial magic and personal refuge blend beneath a ceiling that mirrors the night sky*

## General

- **Type:** Private Living Chambers
- **Description:** Occupying the entire top floor of the Lunar Tower, Luna's private quarters form a circular chamber of remarkable beauty and magical resonance. Access is restricted through a private staircase from the Practical Studies Chamber below, with potent wards guarding the entryway. The most striking feature is the domed ceiling, enchanted to perfectly reflect the current phase of the moon and surrounding stars, creating the impression of sleeping directly beneath the night sky. The chamber's perimeter features enchanted windows that shift to show different views of the night sky from around the world, allowing observation of celestial phenomena regardless of local weather conditions. 

  The central space is dominated by a massive four-poster bed draped in midnight blue and silver silk, its ornate headboard carved with the phases of the moon in silver inlay. Around the circular room, bookshelves alternate with alcoves containing personal artifacts, small shrines to lunar deities, and glowing crystals that provide soft illumination. A personal ritual circle is inlaid in silver on the floor near the eastern window, sized for solitary magical practice. An elegant writing desk positioned to catch the moonlight holds numerous scrolls and star charts, while a comfortable reading nook is built into a window seat offering views of the moon's path across the sky.

  Strategic placement of mirrors throughout the room serves to amplify lunar energy during rituals, while also creating the illusion of infinite space within the chamber. Personal items reflecting Luna's history and magical journey are carefully arranged throughout the space, from childhood mementos to artifacts from her magical training. The overall atmosphere blends scholarly focus with mystical ambiance, creating a space that serves as both personal sanctuary and magical workroom for Luna's most private practices.

The intensely personal nature of the space, filled with objects of both sentimental and magical significance, makes it a physical representation of Luna's inner selfâ€”carefully controlled, sophisticated, and deeply connected to celestial forces.
