# Practical Studies Chamber
*Mystical laboratory where lunar theory transforms into magical praxis amid tools of celestial craft*

## General

- **Type:** Magical Workshop
- **Description:** The third level of the Lunar Tower, this circular chamber serves as Luna's personal workshop and primary magical workspace. The room is arranged with multiple dedicated stations around its perimeter, each designed for different magical operations. Crystal windows line the walls, specially crafted to filter and focus moonlight into precise patterns across the room's interior. The ceiling rises in a gentle dome with silver constellations inlaid against a deep blue background. At the center stands a large circular workbench of polished silver-flecked stone, its surface subtly concave and inscribed with intricate channeling patterns. Shelves and cabinets line the walls between windows, holding countless neatly organized magical components, tools, and works in progress. Several cauldrons of varying sizes and compositions rest on specially designed stands, while delicate instruments for measuring magical energies hang from a revolving apparatus suspended above the central workbench. The air carries a complex blend of scents from herbs, minerals, and subtle magical residues, constantly shifting as different projects progress.
- **Within/Region:** [[Lunar Tower]], [[Lunar Sanctum]], [[Ravenwood Estate]]
- **Contains:** 
	- Central Workbench - Primary workspace with embedded channeling patterns
	- Component Cabinets - Organized storage for magical ingredients
	- Ritual Alcove - Dedicated space for focused ceremonies
	- Cauldron Station - Area for potion brewing and alchemical work
	- Scrying Pool - Small basin for divination practices
	- Enchantment Table - Specialized surface for imbuing objects with lunar properties
- **Affiliations:** [[Thorne Family]], [[Lunar Sanctum]]
- **Significance:** The Practical Studies Chamber represents the active heart of the Lunar Sanctum, where theoretical knowledge is transformed into functional magical applications. As Luna's primary workspace, it reflects her methodical yet innovative approach to lunar magic. The chamber's design incorporates numerous specialized features that facilitate different types of magical work, from potion creation to artifact enchantment to scrying operations. The room's position in the tower makes it a natural focal point for lunar energy, which is further enhanced by the crystal windows and chambering system built into the walls. Access to this chamber is strictly controlled, as it contains both valuable components and potentially dangerous works in progress.
