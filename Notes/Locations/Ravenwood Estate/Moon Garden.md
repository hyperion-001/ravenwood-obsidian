# Moon Garden
*Enchanted grounds where nocturnal flora illuminate the paths of lunar magic*

## General

- **Type:** Magical Garden 
- **Description:** An enchanted circular garden surrounding the base of the Lunar Tower, accessible via a covered walkway from the castle's east wing. White stone pathways wind in a perfect spiral through the garden, each turn aligning with a different lunar phase. At the center stands a crescent-shaped fountain of silvery water that glows with an internal light during nighttime. The garden is primarily planted with night-blooming flowers arranged in sections according to their magical resonance - Lunar Lilies emanate a soft blue glow and enhance divination, Moon Roses unfurl silver petals with healing properties, and Twilight Thistles provide protective energies with their purple luminescence. The entire garden serves as a foundational magical amplifier for the Lunar Sanctum, channeling and refining lunar energies up into the tower above.
- **Within/Region:** [[Ravenwood Estate]] > [[Ravenwood Estate Library of Shadows Sector]] > [[Lunar Sanctum]]
- **Contains:** 
	- Crescent Moon Fountain - Silver-infused water feature that serves as a focal point for lunar energies
	- Phase Spiral Path - White stone walkway that forms a perfect spiral, each turn corresponding to a lunar phase
	- Magical Flora Sections - Plants organized by magical resonance (divination, healing, protection)
	- Enchanted Lanterns - Self-illuminating silver lights that float gently above the paths
- **Affiliations:** [[Thorne Family]], [[Lunar Sanctum]]
- **Significance:** The Moon Garden serves as both the physical foundation and the magical anchor for the entire Lunar Sanctum. Its carefully designed layout creates a natural amplifier for lunar energies, which are then channeled upward through the tower. The garden's plants provide essential components for Luna's magical workings, each blooming according to different phases of the moon. Additionally, the garden creates a protective boundary around the tower, with the magical plants serving as an early warning system against magical intrusion.
