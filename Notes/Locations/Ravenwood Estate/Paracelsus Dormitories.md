# Paracelsus Dormitories
*Hierarchical living quarters where medical ambition is housed in chambers that reveal one's standing in Ravenwood's unspoken order*

## General

- **Type:** Residential Complex
- **Description:** Occupying the fifth, sixth, and seventh floors of the Paracelsus Tower, the dormitories house Ravenwood's medical students, researchers, and visiting scholars in a carefully stratified arrangement that reflects the institution's implicit hierarchy. Each floor contains ten bedchambers arranged around the central spiral staircase, with the quality and size of accommodations improving as one ascends. The rooms are divided into five on each side of the floor, with a small common area at both the northern and southern points of the circular layout serving different purposes according to the floor.

  The fifth floor houses junior students and assistants in modest but comfortable chambers approximately twelve feet square. Each room contains a single bed, a small desk, a washstand, a clothing chest, and a narrow bookshelf. Two students often share a bathroom facility located between adjacent rooms. The common areas on this floor serve primarily as study spaces, with tables for group work and basic reference materials.

  The sixth floor accommodates intermediate students and researchers in more spacious quarters measuring approximately sixteen feet square. These rooms feature larger desks, expanded bookshelves, private washrooms, and small sitting areas suitable for individual consultation or study. The common spaces on this level include a small medical reference library and a modest social gathering area with comfortable seating.

  The seventh floor houses senior researchers, distinguished visitors, and advanced students in elegant chambers measuring approximately twenty feet square. These apartments include separate sleeping and working areas, expanded private washrooms, larger furniture of finer quality, and personalized touches reflecting the occupants' specializations. The common areas on this floor feature sophisticated discussion spaces with fine furnishings and a small dining area for private meals or special gatherings.

  Throughout all levels, the rooms are arranged to optimize natural light from the large windows spaced regularly around the tower's circumference. Interior décor maintains a consistent theme of medical and scientific motifs, with appropriate artwork and architectural details reinforcing the academic environment. The quality of materials, furnishings, and decorative elements increases noticeably with each floor, creating a visual reinforcement of the achievement hierarchy central to Ravenwood's ethos.
