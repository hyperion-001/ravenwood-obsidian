# Val's Chambers 
*A unique cliff-face dwelling where water and air meet, offering both privacy and connection to the depths below*

## General

- **Type:** Private quarters built into castle cliff face 
- **Description:** A remarkable multi-room dwelling carved directly into the eastern cliff face of [[Ravenwood Lake]], positioned several stories above the water's surface. The chambers feature multiple levels connected by both conventional stairs and unusual water-filled shafts. Tall window face westward over the lake, capturing dramatic sunsets and offering unparalleled views of the lake. The main living space combines elegant 18th-century furnishings with curious marine elements—coral formations serve as shelving, abalone shells as decorative inlays, and delicate preserved sea creatures as ornaments. The chambers' most distinctive feature is the private pool room—a large space containing a circular pool fed directly from the lake below through a hidden underwater tunnel, allowing discreet lake access without using the main castle exits. The gentle sound of water pervades all spaces, from the decorative fountains to the subtle lap of waves against the cliff below.

- **Region:** [[Ravenwood Estate]], [[Northmire]], [[Northumberland]] 
- **Culture:** Blend of medical professionalism, marine aesthetics, and aristocratic refinement
- **Affiliations:** [[Ravenwood Estate Castle Proper Sector]], [[Blackwood Family]]
- **Significance:** Val's chambers represent the unique position this character holds at Ravenwood—officially integrated into the castle structure yet literally positioned apart from it, with private access to the lake that accommodates Val's hidden marine nature. The location offers both the respectability required of a senior medical resident and the secrecy needed for Val's true identity, symbolizing the character's dual existence.
