# Central Courtyard Sector
*The elegant central gathering space connecting Ravenwood's diverse sectors through gardens and open-air architecture*

## General

- **Type:** Formal courtyard and gardens
- **Description:** A large open area at the southern entrance of Castle Proper, serving as the central hub connecting the castle's various sectors. The courtyard features elegant formal gardens designed in geometric patterns, with the distinctive Ravenwood white stone used for pathways, fountains, and decorative elements. A central fountain serves as the primary landmark, often used as a meeting point. Covered walkways line the perimeter, providing shelter during inclement weather while maintaining the open-air atmosphere. The space transitions gradually from the more formal northern section near Castle Proper to increasingly functional areas as it approaches other sectors. Strategic plantings, seasonal flowers, and carefully maintained topiary create both beauty and privacy, with certain areas designed for specific purposes such as medicinal herb gardens, contemplation spaces, and small gathering areas.

- **Region:** [[Ravenwood Estate]], [[Northmire]]
- **Culture:** Blend of formal garden tradition and practical estate function
- **Affiliations:** [[Blackwood Family]], various estate sectors
- **Significance:** The Central Courtyard serves as both the literal and symbolic heart of Ravenwood Estate, where the various specialized sectors connect and interact. It provides neutral ground where individuals from different areas of castle life can meet, socialize, and exchange ideas, while also serving practical functions including ceremonial gatherings, outdoor instruction, and cultivation of necessary plant materials. The courtyard's design facilitates movement between sectors while creating discrete spaces for various activities.
