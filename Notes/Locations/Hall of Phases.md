# Hall of Phases
*Ceremonial chamber where the boundaries between worlds thin beneath the dance of lunar magic*

## General

- **Type:** Ritual Chamber
- **Description:** The ground floor of the Lunar Tower, accessible through an ornate door marked with the phases of the moon in silver inlay. This perfectly circular chamber features walls covered in a living archive of lunar magicâ€”flowing, shifting script that reveals different secrets according to the moon's position. The high ceiling holds enchanted silver orbs that emit a cool, silvery light reminiscent of moonlight. The most striking feature is the massive ritual circle inlaid into the polished stone floor, crafted from silver, moonstone, and obsidian in an intricate pattern representing all lunar phases. During the dark moon phase, this circle activates, revealing pathways to the mysterious Shadow Realms. The chamber always maintains a cool temperature with a slight breeze that seems to have no source, and sounds have a peculiar resonance, creating subtle echoes that seem to come from beyond the visible space.
- **Within/Region:** [[Ravenwood Estate]] > [[Ravenwood Estate Library of Shadows Sector]] > [[Lunar Sanctum]]
- **Contains:** 
	- Ritual Circle - Complex inlaid floor design that serves as a portal during specific lunar phases
	- Living Lunar Archive - Walls inscribed with magical text that shifts and changes
	- Enchanted Orbs - Floating silver spheres that provide moonlight-equivalent illumination
	- Phase Markers - Silver inlaid symbols around the room's perimeter
- **Affiliations:** [[Ravenwood Estate]], [[Thorne Family]], [[Lunar Sanctum]]
- **Significance:** The Hall of Phases serves as both the foundation of the Lunar Tower and its most crucial magical component. As the primary access point to the Shadow Realms, it represents one of the few stable gateways to these mysterious dimensions in England. The chamber functions as both a repository of ancient lunar knowledge and a working ritual space for the most significant magical operations. Its construction in 1482 was positioned precisely to align with specific celestial configurations, making it a nexus point for lunar magical energies.
