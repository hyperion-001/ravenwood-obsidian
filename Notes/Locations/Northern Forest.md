# Northern Forest
*Ancient woodland surrounding the silver mines where wilderness reclaims the land and old secrets hide among the trees*

## General

- **Type:** Forested wilderness, forest
- **Description:** A dense, largely untamed forest covering the hills north of Ravenwood Castle, extending from the northern shore of the lake to the silver mines and beyond. Unlike the carefully managed grounds near the castle, the Northern Forest represents true wilderness, with towering ancient trees, thick undergrowth, and natural features untouched by human design. The terrain is varied, with rocky outcroppings, small streams feeding the lake, hidden clearings, and steep hillsides leading up to the mine entrances. The forest grows denser and darker as one moves deeper into the hills, with the oldest trees found in the remote areas near the mines. Numerous animal species make their home here, and local folklore suggests other, more mysterious inhabitants. While paths exist, many are overgrown or difficult to follow, making navigation challenging for those unfamiliar with the woods.

- **Region:** [[Ravenwood Estate]], [[Northmire]]
- **Culture:** Wilderness with elements of local folklore and mining history
- **Affiliations:** [[Natural World]], [[Forest Folklore]]
- **Significance:** The Northern Forest represents the wild, untamed counterpart to Ravenwood's ordered civilization. It serves as both resource and boundary, providing necessary materials while creating a natural barrier between the estate and the outside world. The forest's connection to the silver mines links it to the Blackwood family's wealth and power, while local legends and its imposing presence contribute to the estate's isolation and mysterious reputation. The woods embody the tension between the natural world and human attempts to harness it.
