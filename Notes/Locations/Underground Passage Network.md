# Underground Passage Network
*Labyrinthine veins beneath Ravenwood's surface where secrets, specimens, and researchers move unseen between the estate's vital organs*

## General

- **Type:** Secret Infrastructure System
- **Description:** An extensive network of underground tunnels and passages connecting all major buildings of the Ravenwood Estate, with the Paracelsus Tower serving as its central hub. This sophisticated system exists on multiple levels beneath the surface, with the primary passages wide enough for two people to walk abreast, secondary connections designed for single-file movement, and tertiary maintenance tunnels requiring a hunched posture. The network combines both ancient structures dating back to the original priory and modern additions completed during various expansion phases.

  The main passages feature brick-lined walls with regularly spaced support arches, wooden plank flooring in heavily trafficked areas, and sophisticated drainage systems to prevent flooding. Lighting is provided by secured oil lamps in wall niches, positioned at intervals to provide adequate illumination while minimizing fire risk. Ventilation shafts cleverly disguised as decorative elements on the estate grounds ensure fresh air circulation, with additional mechanical systems in newer sections.

  Access points to the network are carefully concealed within each building, often disguised as storage closets, wall panels, or decorative fixtures. Security is maintained through a hierarchical key system, with certain sections requiring specific access credentials. Major junctions feature small alcoves with benches, basic supplies, and occasionally communication systems for coordinating movement throughout the estate.

  The network is designed not merely for transportation but incorporates specialized features for its various functions. Certain sections have reinforced tracks for wheeled carts transporting heavy equipment or specimens, while others feature wider chambers for temporary storage or emergency shelter. Temperature variations exist throughout the system, with some areas intentionally kept cooler for preservation purposes and others warmed to accommodate longer working periods.

  The most remarkable feature is the central nexus beneath the Paracelsus Tower—a circular chamber with passages radiating outward like spokes from a wheel, each clearly marked with destination indicators and distance measurements. This hub includes a sophisticated lift mechanism connecting directly to Rowyn's Quarters at the tower's summit, allowing for discreet movement between the highest and lowest points of the estate.
- **Within/Region:** [[Ravenwood Estate]], below all major sectors
- **Contains:** 
	- Primary Transport Corridors - Main passageways connecting major buildings
	- Secondary Access Tunnels - Narrower connections to lesser locations
	- Maintenance Passages - Utility access for infrastructure systems
	- Junction Chambers - Where multiple passages intersect
	- Storage Alcoves - Spaces for equipment and emergency supplies
	- [[Passage Nexus]] - Central hub beneath Paracelsus Tower
	- Vertical Access Points - Staircases and lift mechanisms to surface buildings
	- Security Checkpoints - Controlled access to sensitive areas
	- Drainage Systems - Infrastructure preventing flooding
	- Ventilation Network - Air circulation maintaining habitability
- **Affiliations:** [[Blackwood Family]], [[Ravenwood Security]], [[Estate Maintenance Division]]
- **Significance:** The Underground Passage Network represents one of Ravenwood's most valuable yet hidden assets, enabling the discrete movement of personnel, materials, and information that would be inappropriate or impossible above ground. For research requiring privacy from public or even general staff observation, these passages provide essential infrastructure supporting Ravenwood's dual nature as both respectable academic institution and center for unconventional experimentation. Beyond practical functionality, the network embodies the estate's philosophical approach—an elegant surface concealing complex and sometimes troubling depths. The system's hub being positioned beneath the Paracelsus Tower rather than the main castle reflects the true power center of the estate's operations, where medical innovation takes precedence over traditional authority.
