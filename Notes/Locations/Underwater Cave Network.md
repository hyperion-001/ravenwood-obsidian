# Underwater Cave Network
*Hidden aquatic labyrinth beneath [[Ravenwood Estate]] connecting lake, mines, and castle through flooded passages of ancient origin*

## General

- **Type:** Submerged cave system
- **Description:** An extensive network of underwater passages extending beneath Ravenwood Estate, connecting Ravenwood Lake to the flooded lower levels of the silver mines and several access points within the castle itself. The caves feature a mix of completely submerged tunnels and partially flooded chambers with air pockets, some large enough to serve as hidden gathering spaces. The geology is distinctive, with smooth water-carved limestone in older sections contrasting with the jagged mine-cut tunnels where human excavation breached the natural caverns. Throughout the system, veins of Ravenwood cobalt create striking blue-silver patterns along the walls, occasionally emitting the faint luminescence characteristic of the metal. The water itself has unusual properties—exceptional clarity in most areas and a slightly higher mineral content than the lake surface, giving it a subtle blue tint visible in deeper sections. The network serves as a hidden transit system for those capable of underwater navigation, with Val Blackfin's chambers featuring one of the few easily accessible entrance points designed for regular use.

- **Region:** [[Ravenwood Estate]], [[Northmire]]
- **Culture:** Maritime secrets, hidden knowledge, natural mystery
- **Affiliations:** Natural formation with human modifications
- **Significance:** The Underwater Cave Network provides a secret infrastructure beneath Ravenwood, allowing hidden movement between key locations and serving as a sanctuary for those with marine adaptations like Val Blackfin. The caves also connect to the estate's history through the flooded mine levels, where the pursuit of Ravenwood cobalt eventually led to breaching the natural caverns. The network's existence is known to few, making it valuable for covert operations and private research, while its unusual properties—possibly derived from dissolved cobalt minerals—may contribute to Monarchium research and other scientific pursuits.
