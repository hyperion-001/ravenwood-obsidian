Amidst the barbaric medical backdrop of 18th century Great Britain and the Seven Years War unfolds *The Surgeon's Apprentice* an gothic tale of discovery and darkness, where the line between healer and harm grows increasingly thin. In the candle-lit chambers of Ravenwood Castle, the clash of surgical instruments mingles with truth and lies, forming a story that will challenge everything about medicine, morality, and the pursuit of knowledge at any cost.

I invite you, then, to join me in exploring the darker side of human knowledge and ambition – the side of the coin pressed against the table while its opposite faces the light. Let us turn that coin over together and venture beyond the boundaries of the ordinary and ethically comfortable. Let us examine this darker face and discover what awaits us on the other side.

*The Surgeon's Apprentice* is told progressively through a collection of documents from 18th century England. We'll encounter diary entries, letters, surgical reports, research notes, military orders, royal decrees, and papal mandates – each offering a unique window into this world. These documents often tell the same events from different perspectives, letting you piece together the truth from multiple viewpoints. 

In creating Ravenwood and *The Surgeon's Apprentice*, I've worked within the framework of historical fiction. It is a story using real historical places, people, and events as the foundation, then carefully constructing new elements that feel true to the period. While some documents we encounter are signed by real historical figures from the period, the documents themselves are fictional.

Many parts of this narrative are absolutely factual – the historical medical practices, British political landscape, Seven Years' War, social structures, and nobility system are all drawn from history. Other aspects required some creative liberty, like exploring how historical figures might have thought about certain issues, or how medical theories of the time might have developed in interesting directions.

I've also taken some real locations and reimagined them to build our story's setting. Ravenwood Castle, for instance, would sit near the actual town of Harbottle in Northumbria's beautiful Coquet River valley. If you ever visit the area, you'll find the Drake Stone – a real landmark that inspired Ravenwood's "Chrysalis Stone." While you won't find Ravenwood Castle there today, the landscape that shaped our story very much exists.

One of my favorite parts of crafting this world has been building on real scientific knowledge. Take Monarchium, our fictional compound. I've designed it based on modern biochemical and pharmaceutical theory, making sure its structure and effects could actually work within the bounds of current pharmaceutical science.

This scientific foundation brings me to the heart of what I explore in Ravenwood: What do we do with the knowledge and capabilities available to us? Is knowledge alone sufficient? Should we act on every capability we possess? These ethical questions have haunted mankind for millennia and remain equally relevant today.

Thank you to everyone that has helped me develop this narrative and its delivery and continually helps me every day. They work hard not only to help me present my dreams here to you but they work equally hard in listening to my ramblings at all hours of the day and night. They are great friends as well as great at what they do. 

I thank every person reading this just for being here and taking part in these crazy dreams of mine in whatever capacity.

Enjoy *The Surgeon's Apprentice*.



## A Quick Note on Georgian Medicine
To understand our story, it helps to know that 18th-century doctors saw the body very differently than we do today. While we talk about pharmacology and biochemistry, Georgian physicians viewed everything through the lens of four cardinal humors: blood, phlegm, black bile, and yellow bile. They believed health came from these humors being in perfect balance, and illness from them being out of whack.

When it came to pain, they thought it happened because of disruptions in the body's "vital spirits" and "animal heat." These disruptions might come from having too much of one humor, not enough of another, or outside forces messing with the body's natural balance. So instead of targeting specific symptoms like we do now, they focused on restoring overall balance – maybe through bloodletting to reduce excess blood, using emetics to purge bile, or giving opiates to calm those agitated spirits.

While this might sound strange to our modern ears, it gave Georgian physicians a complete system for understanding and treating illness. It's also the foundation that characters like Lucian build upon as they push medicine in new and sometimes dangerous directions.
