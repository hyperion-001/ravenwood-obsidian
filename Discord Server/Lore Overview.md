# WELCOME TO RAVENWOOD

## THE SETTING
In the secluded region of Northmire stands Ravenwood Castle, an imposing country estate that embodies both grandeur and mystery. Built upon the foundations of a 13th-century priory, this architectural marvel was transformed in the mid-1700s into a sprawling fortress of knowledge and innovation.

The castle's striking Gothic-Renaissance design features pristine white stone, intricate towers, and sprawling terraces. At its heart, a masterfully engineered double-helix staircase spirals through the structure, symbolizing the intertwining of knowledge and ambition that defines this remarkable place.

## THE ERA (1750-1780)
Step into a transformative period of history, where the Enlightenment era meets the Scientific Revolution. This is a time of intellectual renaissance, when traditional boundaries between science, alchemy, engineering, and medicine begin to blur. In the halls of Ravenwood, brilliant minds push the boundaries of what's possible, driven by both noble aspirations and dangerous ambitions.
