# WELCOME TO RAVENWOOD

In the secluded depths of Northmire, where fog clings to ancient stone and whispers echo through candlelit corridors, Ravenwood Castle stands as both a testament to medical innovation and a guardian of darker secrets. The year is 1762, and within these walls, the boundaries between healing and harm, between ambition and obsession, grow ever thinner.

You find yourself drawn here, perhaps by fate, perhaps by design. The castle's endless corridors beckon, each flagstone worn smooth by centuries of footsteps. In the surgical theatre, silver instruments gleam with terrible possibility. The library holds knowledge that pulses like a living thing, its tomes whispering promises of power to those brave—or foolish—enough to listen.

Here, under the guidance of Lucian, the Royal Surgeon, medical science pushes relentlessly forward. His most promising student, Seraphina, works tirelessly in pursuit of revolutionary breakthroughs in pain management. Yet there are those who whisper that some discoveries were never meant to be made, some doors never meant to be opened.

As you take your place among the castle's residents, you'll find more than just medical education awaits. Every shadow holds a story, every locked door conceals a mystery, and every choice you make will echo through these ancient halls.

Will you pursue knowledge at any cost? Or will you recognize the moment when ambition becomes obsession?

The candle is lit. The instruments are laid out. The next chapter awaits.

Welcome to Ravenwood.

*The castle's doors stand open. What path will you choose?*
