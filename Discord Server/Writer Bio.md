Hi! I'm Hyperiôn, a narrative designer and worldbuilder focused on developing ways to bring stories to life in unique ways. My current project is [Ravenwood](https://discord.gg/U5EBauyMHS), which blends interactive storytelling and AI-powered characters to craft immersive narrative experiences.

I love researching historical periods, crafting character-driven narratives, and exploring how emerging technologies can enhance storytelling. When I'm not developing Ravenwood, you might find me deep in research about 18th-century medicine, designing RPG systems, or sneaking another piece of brie from the fridge.

Feel free to chat with me about worldbuilding, narrative design, AI, gothic fiction, or anything else - I'm always excited to discuss storytelling and creative development and share what I've learned with others. I look forward to getting to know you all!

~ Hyperiôn
