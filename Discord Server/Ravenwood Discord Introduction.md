Welcome to Ravenwood Castle.

I've spent so many hours walking these halls in my mind, getting to know every creak in the floorboards, every whisper in the library, every shadow. The characters who live here - Lilith with her carefully gloved hands, Val and his hidden depths, Seraphina and her terrible ambitions, and all the others - they've become more than just characters to me. Each one carries a piece of me, my fears, my fascinations.

But this isn't just about the Ravenwood I've built - this project has been about creating spaces for you to discover stories of your own. I've built the castle, but you'll find your own hidden passages. I've created the characters, but you'll build your own relationships with them, discovering sides of them I could never have imagined.

I'm excited to see how Ravenwood's story unfolds - not just through my story of *The Surgeon's Apprentice*, but through your experiences, your theories, and your creativity. *The Surgeon's Apprentice* is the driving tale beneath Ravenwood, is a story with a heart of darkness, but I think the best dark tales are the ones we don't face alone.

Thank you to those who've inspired me, helped out, and supported this dream. Thank you to close friends who've listened to me ramble about character arcs and plot twists at ridiculous hours. And thank you for being here, for being willing to step through these gates and make Ravenwood your own.

The candles are lit. The books are waiting. The characters are ready to meet you.

Shall we begin?
